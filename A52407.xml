            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

They are now come forth, by the labour and diligence of them that priz'd his Perſon, and honour'd his Miniſtry; whereunto, although I was not in a Capacity of contributing any furtherance, yet I could not in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience let them paſs into the World without doing this right to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Publiſhers, and to the Papers themſelves, as to give in my poor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, That they are the genuine iſſue of him whoſe <hi>Name</hi> they bear; whereby, <hi>though dead, he yet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> My humble Prayer to God ſhall be, That into what hand ſoever Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence may put them, the ſame Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which accompanied the hearing of them, may go along with the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them alſo; for the rendring of them effectual to their ſpiritual and everlaſting good.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>ALthough theſe Sermons, (beſides the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of being Poſthumous works) had the unhappineſs to want the Authors own poliſhing (for which cauſe it is but juſtice, that if any miſtake ſhould poſſibly be diſcerned in them, it may not be laid at the Authors door) yet I am informed they were taken by the Pen of a ready Writer, and a worthy friend of the Authors, as appears. And having peruſed moſt of them, I cannot deny them this juſt Teſtimony, That I find in them
<pb facs="tcp:45614:6"/>the Spirit and Lineaments of that worthy Perſon, whoſe name they bear; a Perſon, whoſe name needs no imbalming, having ſo many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Tombs in the hearts of thoſe who were either eye or ear-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his great worthineſs; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them, in whom he left ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of true Piety, as doubtleſs will abide with them for ever, and carry his bleſſed memory into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. And amongſt the reſt of his Excellencies, this was not the leaſt, that like precious Diamonds they were deep ſet in a profound Humility and unexampled Modeſty, whereby he ever was moſt contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in his own eyes: a great reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of any worth in his Brethren, but a great deſpiſer and peremptory denier of it in himſelf (the only thing wherein he might be taxed for falſe and unjuſt dealing). And that
<pb facs="tcp:45614:6"/>which concealed his Virtues, did moſt higly commend them, whilſt like the Sun breaking through a Cloud, it appeared more glorious, in ſpight of that Vail which his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent humbleneſs of mind threw upon it. I might ſay much of his fervent Love and tender Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Souls of men, his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſpend and to be ſpent for the good of his people (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the frowardneſs and unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of divers of them); his indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigableneſs in ſerving the ſpiritual neceſſities of any who make known their deſires to him; his great inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and candour towards his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. What the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> ſaith of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Life (how truly I know not, ſince <hi>Jeſuits</hi> allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the liberty of Equivocation) is much more true of him, that he was <hi>Candidus erga alios, ſeverus erga ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45614:7"/>He was a moſt candid Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of other mens actions, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively ſevere to himſelf.</p>
            <p>But I muſt remember, I am not now writing a Panegyrick in praiſe of the Author, but a ſhort introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to a more profitable work: And therefore I ſhall conclude the Readers trouble with this only inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; That the Subjects here treated of are practical and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: the manner of handling them plain and powerful, and ſuch as, coming ſo evidently from the heart of the Speaker, are moſt likely to make impreſſion upon the heart of the Reader: and the time (I am ſure) is not unſeaſonable, ſeeing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author is gone to the place of ſilence, whence you will hear him no more.</p>
            <p>The Lord who was pleaſed often to accompany his Word when it was
<pb facs="tcp:45614:7"/>by him preached <hi>viva voce</hi> to the Hearers, continue the powerful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Grace in the reading of it. And let ſuch as read theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, get another Edition of them Printed in their hearts, ſo as they may be read in their lives, whereby they will anſwer the deſign and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Preacher and Publiſhers.</p>

            <p>THis Pſalm, for the kind of it, is Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical, a Thanksgiving-Pſalm. The occaſion of penning this Pſalm in the judgment of Interpreters was this, <hi>Davids</hi> eſtabliſhment in the Kingdom, after that he had been hunted like a Partridg upon the Mountains, driven from his own Country, and baniſhed into a Wilderneſs, and purſued like a Traitor; when after all theſe dangers, and fears, and ſnares, and oppoſition that he met with from <hi>Saul,</hi> and from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45614:11"/>his bloody and implacable enemies, God had now ſetled him in the Kingdom, &amp; brought his hope into his hand, and had lifted up his head above his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and had trodden his enemies under his feet: now what he had won by prayer, he wears with thankfulneſs, <hi>I will praiſe thee</hi> (ſays he in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſes) <hi>with my whole heart: I will worſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thy holy Temple, and praiſe thy name for thy loving-kindneſs, and for thy truth:</hi> (for thy <hi>loving-kindneſs</hi> in promiſing, and for thy <hi>truth</hi> in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>for thou haſt magnified thy word above all thy name.</hi> In the 2d verſe, it is a dark ſentence at the firſt view; but as a judicious Expoſitor upon the place well obſerves, the words may be thus read, and will better agree with the Hebrew, <hi>Thou haſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thy name above all things in thy word:</hi> that is, in fulfilling thy word: thou haſt magnified thy name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, in that thou haſt fulfilled thy word; what thou freely promiſedſt, thou haſt faithfully performed; what thou haſt ſpoken with thy mouth, thou haſt fulfilled with thy hand; for which thy name is wonderfully to be magnified. The name of God is that whereby God is known: thy name is wonderfully magnified in fulfilling thy word; nay, <hi>thy name is magnified above all things,</hi> that is the meaning of the phraſe. For the proof and evidence of this truth, That God is wonderfully to be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified for fulfilling his promiſe, for making good his word to his Servant: for the proof of this, <hi>David</hi> brings in his own experience to ſet ſeal thereto in the words of the Text, for, ſays he, <hi>In the day when I cryed to thee, thou anſweredſt me, and ſtrengthenedſt me with ſtrength in my ſoul.</hi> So then in this verſe you may take notice of theſe two particulars:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, You have Gods free favour and gracious
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45614:11"/>dealing with <hi>David</hi> in the day of his fears, and of his ſtraits, in theſe words, <hi>In the day when I cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou anſweredſt me.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, You have the evidence or proof of this free favour of God towards him, in an experience that he had of it; for ſays he, <hi>Thou ſtrengthenedſt me with ſtrength in my ſoul:</hi> and accordingly there are theſe two points of doctrine that may be fairly deduced from this Text.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 1.</hi> That the Lord is ready to anſwer the Prayers of his poor ſervants when they cry unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 2.</hi> It is one gracious way of anſwering our Prayers, when God does ſtrengthen us with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtrength, when he gives us ſtrength in our ſouls. <hi>I begin with the firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord is very ready to hear and anſwer the prayers of his poor ſervants when they cry unto him.</hi> For the proof of this point, I could bring you a whole cloud of witneſſes out of the book of God: but I will content my ſelf with three or four: That in the 107 <hi>Pſalm, Then they cryed unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their diſtreſſes:</hi> and it is four times repeated in that one Pſalm, for the confirmation of our faith, becauſe we are ſo backward to believe the truth of it: and he gives four inſtances of men that were brought into great ſtraits, and ſtill when they cryed unto the Lord, the Lord delivered them out of their diſtreſſes: and remarkable is that Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.19, <hi>For the people ſhall dwell in</hi> Zion, <hi>at</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>thou ſhalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry: when he ſhall hear it he ſhall anſwer thee:</hi> Mark, he will be very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to thee at the voice of thy cry: you ſhall ſee the experience of it in two of Gods Saints and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45614:12"/>Servants, that had taſted of Gods goodneſs in this particular, and have ſet it down for our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: one was the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the Dungeon, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.55, 56, <hi>I called upon thy name, O Lord: out of the low Dungeon thou haſt heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry:</hi> God had an ear for his very breathing. The other example is that of the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Whales belly, in that remarkable place, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.2, <hi>Then</hi> Jonah <hi>prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fiſhes belly, and ſaid, I cryed by reaſon of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me: out of the belly of hell cryed I, and thou heardſt my voice.</hi> If you would know a reaſon why God is thus ready to hear and anſwer the prayers of his Servants when they cry, take theſe three or four reaſons briefly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe of Gods faithfulneſs: He is very faithful that hath promiſed: <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will hear and anſwer, and thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> Pſal. 50.15. So in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.24, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that before they call, I will anſwer: and whiles they are yet ſpeaking, I will hear.</hi> God is faithful to his promiſes, <hi>All his promiſes in Jeſus Chriſt are yea, and in him they are amen.</hi> Our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs cannot make him unfaithful: if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, he remains faithful, he cannot deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God hears his Servants prayers, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that compaſſion that is in him towards them; as he is very faithful, ſo he is very pitiful: as he hath beams of Majeſty, ſo hath he alſo bowels of mercy; and his bowels yearn towards his poor children when they cry to him: <hi>Can a mother for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her ſucking-child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the ſon of her womb? yea, they may forget,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45614:12"/>yet will I not forget thee, Iſa.</hi> 49.15. A tender-hearted mother, if ſhe hear her little child whimper in the cradle, that does not move her; but if the child cry to purpoſe, then her bowels yearn towards it: ſhe can ſtay no longer from it, but runs in all haſte to it: ſo here, when we do but whimper, pray coldly, God may be, is not ready to hear; but if we cry in prayer, if we follow God with our ſupplications, then his bowels cannot but yearn towards us.</p>
            <p>Third reaſon, Becauſe Gods ſervants have Jeſus Chriſt to pray for them: <hi>We have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous:</hi> he is pleading our cauſe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. And <hi>he ever lives to make interceſſion for us, Heb.</hi> 7.25. Nay, his very preſence with the Father, is our interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: he appears in the preſence of God for us: he appears as our advocate, in our ſtead, for our good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true: but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth reaſon is this, Becauſe the ſervants of God have not only Chriſt to pray for them, but they have the Spirit of Chriſt to pray in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought: but the ſpirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groans which cannot be uttered.</hi> If you ask me, But how does the ſpirit of God help our infirmities? I anſwer, Theſe four or five ways.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The ſpirit of God helps our infirmities, by affecting us with them, with our wants and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; that being humbled and lying low at the feet of God, we may be veſſels more capable of mercy.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45614:13"/>God will not pour in the oyl of his mercy, but into the veſſels of a broken heart; now the ſpirit of God by a ſight and ſenſe of our manifold infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, doth empty us, and work in us ſome kind of brokenneſs of heart, and ſo fits us for mercy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Again, the ſpirit of God helps our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities likewiſe, by acting his own graces in us, by acting thoſe beginnings of faith, and love, and humility, and ſelf-denial, which he himſelf hath wrought in us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By ſtirring up in us holy motions, holy deſires, and pantings, and breathings after our heavenly Father, even ſuch breathings as theſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God: my ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God: when ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> when wilt thou come to me? when ſhall I come to thee? And, <hi>my ſoul followeth hard after God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The ſpirit of God helps our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, by working in us a childlike-boldneſs, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling us to cry <hi>Abba Father:</hi> we can come to God as a child to a Father; Father, I want this, I want that: God is delighted to hear the moan-makings of his poor children.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, By reſtraining Satan, that he may not interrupt us and diſtract us in holy ſervices; for this is certain, we ſeldom go to duty, but Satan ſtill ſtands at our right-hand: When <hi>Joſhua the high Prieſt ſtood before the Angel of the Lord, Satan ſtood at his right-hand to reſiſt him, Zach.</hi> 3.2. But now, Jeſus Chriſt he is ſtronger than Satan, and he by his ſpirit does rebuke him. But there is one great objection I know will be ready to ariſe in every one of your hearts: You ſay, God is ready to hear and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45614:13"/>anſwer the prayers of his poor ſervants when they cry to him; but ſome will ſay, Experience ſeems to deny this: Gods own ſervants pray oft, and yet they have no anſwer; nay, God is ſometimes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the prayers of his ſervants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4, <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, how long wilt thou be angry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prayer of thy people?</hi> the prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> he profeſſes he cryed to God and ſhouted, and yet God ſhut out his prayers, and wrapt himſelf in a cloud, that his prayers ſhould not paſs through, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.44, <hi>Thou haſt covered thy ſelf with a cloud, that our prayers ſhould not paſs through.</hi> It may be ſome will ſay, I have been praying for ſuch a grace twenty, thirty years together, and yet have not got it; for ſtrength againſt ſuch a corruption, and yet have not got it. For anſwer to this objection you muſt know,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gods people ſometimes pray not when they ſeem to pray.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God hears his people, when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſeems not to hear.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gods people pray not when they ſeem to pray, as when they pray coldly and careleſly, this is as no prayer; as the Apoſtle ſaid in the like caſe, <hi>When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lords Supper,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. as if he ſhould ſay, irregular, unprepared recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, is not receiving at all: as good never a whit, as never the better; ſo here, cold, careleſs, formal, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary prayer, is as no prayer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.13. <hi>All this evil is come upon us, yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God, that me might turn from our iniquities, and underſtand thy truth;</hi> for theſe ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years hath thine hand been heavy upon us, yet we have not made our prayers before the Lord
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45614:14"/>our God: we made a ſhew of praying, but our careleſs praying may be ſaid to be no praying.</p>
            <p>Again, Gods people in praying may be ſaid not to pray at all, when they exerciſe only gifts in prayer, and have not the grace of prayer: for you muſt know, the power and prevalency of prayer doth not conſiſt in the neatneſs of the phraſe, nor in the redundancy of rhetorick, nor in curious oratory; it conſiſts not in outward expreſſions; but it conſiſts in the humility of a ſpirit wounded, and looking up to God; it conſiſts in this, God looks at this, the frame of the ſpirit, not at the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſions in prayer: a man may by the ſtrength of parts have an excellent gift in prayer, and yet not the grace thereof: If you ask me, How may a man know the difference between the gift of prayer, and the grace of prayer? I anſwer (brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly), you may know it by theſe particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, The gift of prayer vents it ſelf in publick more than in private; but now the grace of prayer vents it ſelf more in private than in publick: it will enable a man in his private cloſet, to pour out his ſoul before God, when there is no witneſs but his heavenly Father and his own conſcience.</item>
               <item>Secondly, You ſhall obſerve the gift of prayer puffs a man up with pride; but now the grace of prayer makes a man very lowly and baſe in his own eyes; the more grace a man hath in his heart, the more baſe he will be in his own account, even in his greateſt enlargements.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, The gift of prayer makes a man pray in the ſtrength of his parts; but now the grace of prayer makes a man pray in the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt.</item>
               <item>Fourthly, The gift of prayer expects an eccho
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45614:14"/>of commendation from men; but now the grace of prayer that expects only an approbation from God.</item>
               <item>Fifthly, The gift of prayer vents it ſelf in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſions: but the grace of prayer conſiſts in the inward impreſſions upon the heart, not the outward expreſſions of the mouth.</item>
               <item>Sixthly, The gift of prayer will quiet the heart for the preſent, but it doth not purifie the heart: it will quiet the heart, it will ſtop the mouth of a chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding conſcience, which otherwiſe would be rating at us: if a man neglect prayer as a gift, his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will be unquiet; but now the grace of prayer will not only quiet, but purifie the conſcience.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The ſecond part of the anſwer to the objection is this: The objection was this: Experience ſeems to deny this truth, that God is ready to hear and anſwer the prayers of his people. I have a ſecond anſwer, and that is this: God may be ſaid to hear and anſwer the prayers of his people when he ſeems not to hear: as we may ſeem to pray, when we do not pray; ſo God may be ſaid to hear, when he ſeems not to hear: for example,</p>
            <p>Firſt, God ſeems not to hear when he hears, when he puts our prayers into his book, and our tears into his bottle; when he hath a book of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance for our prayers, when our prayers are upon the file, though for the preſent we do not ſee them anſwered, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.4. God ſpeaks to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> there, <hi>Thy prayers and alms are come up for a memorial before me: Cornelius</hi> was ready to think, I have prayed thus long, I have loſt all my labour, I ſee no fruit, no benefit of them; but ſaith God to him, Thy prayers are in remembrance, they are upon the file for all that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45614:15"/>Secondly, God hears when he ſeems not to hear; namely, when he is fitting us for the mercy he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to beſtow upon us: God makes his people wait for a mercy, as appears out of thoſe words, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17, <hi>I will wait upon the Lord that hideth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his face from the houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and will look up:</hi> And God ſays, that he will wait that he may be gracious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. God waits opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to beſtow mercies when they are moſt ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when his people are fitted for mercy. A man that is about to pour in ſome precious oyl into a glaſs, if he ſee ſome dirt at the bottom of the glaſs, he ſtops his hand for the preſent, ſays he, Let the glaſs be waſht firſt, then I will pour in the oyl: ſo if our hearts be once waſht and fit ro receive the mercy we beg, then God will beſtow it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14, <hi>Oh</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>waſh thy heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayſt be ſaved:</hi> when we waſh away our ſins by repentance, and are fit for mercy, then God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows it on us; in the mean time he hears, though he ſeems not to hear.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God hears when he ſeems not to hear: when he hears according to our wants though not according to our wills: when he beſtows upon us that which is better than that we pray for, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34.10, <hi>The greedy Lions ſhall lack and ſuffer hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: but they that ſeek the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing:</hi> if it be good for them, they ſhall not want it: if peace and plenty, and proſperity were good for them, they ſhall not want it, but God would beſtow it upon them: but if they would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their peace, and plenty, and proſperity, to pride and preſumption, then the denial of them would be a great mercy: God ſometimes denies that in mercy to his children, which he grants in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45614:15"/>anger to wicked and ungodly men: it is better a thouſand times to be under the frowns of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, than under the ſmiles of his vengeance; it is better to weep with Chriſt, than ſport with Satan; its better to be a corrected child, than a cockered baſtard; <hi>If we want chaſtiſement, whereof all are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, then are we baſtards and not ſons, Heb.</hi> 12.8. its better to be chaſtiſed of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world, than ſpared with the world and condemned to all eternity. A man at the firſt view would wonder at Gods dealing with <hi>Paul,</hi> and his dealing with Satan; Satan beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that he might have liberty to tempt <hi>Job:</hi> God anſwered Satan, and gives him leave, <hi>Job</hi> 1, <hi>Go thy way and tempt him. Paul</hi> on the other ſide, he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly begged to be free from the buffetings of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, he begged thrice that God would remove the thorn in the fleſh: and this was all the anſwer he could have for the preſent, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee:</hi> Why, may ſome ſay, doth God anſwer Satan in his requeſt about <hi>Jobs</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and not <hi>Paul</hi> in his requeſt about the Devils buffeting him? why was God more ready to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify Satan in his requeſt, than <hi>Paul</hi> in his, who was a choſen veſſel? A man would wonder at this; but if you obſerve it well, <hi>Paul</hi> was heard in that he was not heard, and the Devil was not heard in that he was heard,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Paul</hi> was heard in that he was not heard: for he was heard to his advantage, though he was not heard in the letter of his requeſt: he beg'd that the thorn in the fleſh might be removed: Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee:</hi> God in giving him ſupporting grace under the temptation, gave a fitter mercy for <hi>Paul</hi> than the removal of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45614:16"/>temptation; becauſe God ſaw that <hi>Paul</hi> by reaſon of the multitude of his Revelations, had need to be kept humble; therefore my ſuppoting-grace is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee, than the deliverance thou beggeſt. <hi>Paul</hi> was heard in that he was not heard: though he was not heard in the letter of his requeſt, yet he was heard for the better, for his advantage.</p>
            <p>On the contrary; The Devil was not heard in that he was heard: he beg'd liberty to tempt <hi>Job,</hi> God gave him leave, <hi>Job</hi> 1, <hi>Lo, he is in thy hand, all he hath is in thy power;</hi> but what did the Devil get by it? he was baffled, and fool'd, and prov'd a lyar to his face; for <hi>Job,</hi> notwithſtanding all the loſſes upon his eſtate, kept his integrity, and ſinned not; but ſaith the Devil, <hi>Put forth thine hand and touch his bone and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face: and the Lord ſaid, Lo, he is in thy hand, but ſave his life:</hi> then the Devil uſed all his art he could to make him blaſpheme God, but he could not prevail; ſo the Devil was proved a lyar to his face.</p>
            <p>Now the uſe I ſhall make is this, This doctrine may be like <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> to hold up <hi>Moſes</hi> hands: it is a great encouragement to every one of us to pray ſtill, to ſeek the face of God ſtill; though he ſeem to delay us, or deny our importunities, or to turn from us; yet follow God ſtill: though he ſeem to deny our prayers, yet give not over praying: for you ſee God will at one time or other, in one kind or other, anſwer all the prayers that are put up to him: <hi>In the day when I cryed, thou anſweredſt me.</hi> Let me tell you, We ſhall never have cauſe to repent of our praying: could we pray an hundred times more than we do, we ſhould never have cauſe to repent of our praying, except it be for this, That we have prayed no more frequently and fervently.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45614:16"/>And ſo much for the firſt point of doctrine.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point of doctrine is this, <hi>It is one gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious way of anſwering our prayers, when God doth beſtow upon us ſome ſpiritual ſtrength:</hi> When he beſtows ſtrength in our ſouls, that is one way of Gods anſwering our prayers graciouſly; if he do not give the thing we deſire, yet if he gives us ſtrength in our ſouls, he graciouſly anſwers our prayers. For the better clearing of this point it may be demanded, What is this ſpiritual ſtrength? I anſwer, it is a work of the ſpirit of God, enabling a man to do and ſuffer what God would have him, without fainting or backſliding.</p>
            <p>I call it a work of the ſpirit of God, becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is the ſpirit of God that does corroborate and ſtrengthen the ſoul: <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16, <hi>That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthened with might by his ſpirit in the inner man.</hi> Alas, we of our ſelves, if we have not the ſpirit of God to help us, are as weak as water; we are no more able to ſtand in a day of trial, or withſtand any temptation, than a little child is able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a giant; but now when <hi>Sampſon</hi> was cloathed with the ſpirit, then he could grapple with a Lion; ſo when once we are cloathed with the ſpirit of God, we ſhall be able to encounter with Lion-like corruptions and temptations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereby a man is able to do and ſuffer what God would have him to do and ſuffer: there is ſtrength, conſiderable ſtrength required in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of God, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1.7, <hi>Only be thou ſtrong and very couragious, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do according to all the Law which</hi> Moſes <hi>my ſervant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right-hand, or the left, that thou mayeſt proſper whither ſoever
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45614:17"/>thou goeſt;</hi> but there is a great deal more ſtrength required in ſuffering. <hi>Paul</hi> had attained a great deal of ſtrength, when he ſaid, <hi>For the Lord Chriſt his ſake I have ſuffered the loſs of all things,</hi> Phil. 3.8.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſay, whereby a man is enabled to do and ſuffer what God requires without fainting, and backſliding: there is ſtrength required in doing the will of God, but there is much ſtrength required in ſuffering; I, but yet more ſtrength is required in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance; for if we faint in the day of adverſity, our ſtrength is but ſmall, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.10. and therefore ſays the Apoſtle, We muſt often <hi>look upon Jeſus Chriſt the author and finiſher of our faith; and conſider him who endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, leſt we be weary &amp; faint in our minds, Heb.</hi> 12.3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It may be demanded, how doth God ſtrengthen a man with ſtrength in his ſoul? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, theſe three ways:</p>
            <p>Firſt, God ſtrengthens a Chriſtian with ſpiritual ſtrengths, when he doth comfort him in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his love ſhed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghoſt; Oh, this will enable a man to bear any burthen! Smite Lord (will ſuch a one ſay) I will bear any thing willingly; becauſe my ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God ſtrengthens us with ſtrength in our ſouls, by encouraging us in our ſufferings, by cheering up our hearts with ſome inward cordial. Look how God cheer'd up Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he was in danger, when forty men ſwore his death, in <hi>Acts</hi> 23.11, <hi>And the night following the Lord ſtood by him, and ſaid, Be of good cheer,</hi> Paul: <hi>for as thou haſt teſtified for me in</hi> Hieruſalem, <hi>ſo muſt thou bear witneſs alſo at</hi> Rome. So when God comes and cheers up the heart, and brings ſome of his beſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45614:17"/>cordials in our worſt fainting fits: when in our ſtrongeſt afflictions he brings in his ſweeteſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: when we are able to ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 94.19, <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy Comforts delight my ſoul:</hi> when God brings in his divine comforts, then he ſtrengthens us with ſtrength in our ſouls. As I remember when <hi>Philip Landſgrave,</hi> being long priſoner under <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, being demanded what cheered him up in that condition; made this anſwer, I feel, ſays he, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine comforts of the martyrs. God hath divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts for his people in their fainting fits: as their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions abound: ſo he makes his comforts to abound.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God ſtrengthens with ſtrength in the ſoul, when he does ſupport and keep up the ſpirit from ſinking: ſays <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 94.17, 18, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs the Lord had been my helper, my ſoul had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dwelt in ſilence: but when I ſaid, my foot ſlipped, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.</hi> That is an excellent Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10, <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: be not diſmayed for I am thy God, I will ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, when God does ſupport a man, though the affliction be never ſo heavy; yet it ſhall not ſink him, but he ſhall be able to ſtand under it: ſee it in <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.4, when he was at <hi>Ziglag,</hi> when there was ſuch a load of afflictions upon him, <hi>he wept that he could weep no longer:</hi> his own ſoldiers mutinied, his wives were taken and carried captive, yet God ſupported him in that great diſtreſs. On the contrary, under leſs temptations and troubles, if God do not ſupport a man, he will fall; ſee it in <hi>Ahitophel;</hi> becauſe his counſel was not accepted, God not ſupporting him under this light trouble, he goes and hangs himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:45614:18"/>For the uſe of this: If this be one way of Gods hearing our prayers, when he ſtrengthens us with ſtrength in our ſouls; Then call your ſelves to an account, whether God hath ſtrengthned your ſouls yea or no: here is divers of you that have been made partakers of a ſtrengthening Ordinance this day, namely, the Lords Supper, which the Lord Jeſus hath appointed for your ſpiritual confirmation and corroboration. Now will it not nearly concern you to ask your own ſouls this queſtion, Hath God ſtrengthened you with ſtrength in your ſouls? It may be you will ſay to me, how ſhall we do to know it? Anſwer me but theſe four or five queſtions, and you may know it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, tell me, What are you in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and temptations? for what a man is in tryals, that is the man: Can you live in a time of ſtraits, fears, doubts and dangers? as the ſtrength of a ſhip is tryed in the time of a ſtorm; if ſhe can live in a ſtorm, then you may ſay ſhe is a ſtrong ſhip: the ſtrength of a Caſtle, is tryed in the time of battel; if it can endure the roaring Cannon, then its a ſtrong Caſtle: now if you can keep your ſtanding in a time of danger, this argues you have received ſpiritual ſtrength in your ſouls.</item>
               <item>Secondly, Can you bear variety of conditions without fainting? can you paſs through good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ill report, through honour and diſhonour, through a proſperous eſtate and decayed eſtate? can you paſs through theſe with an equal temper and frame of ſpirit? as you are not puft up with proſperity, ſo you are not too much caſt down with adverſity. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had this ſtrength, <hi>I have learnt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in what eſtate ſoever I am, therewith to be content.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:45614:18"/>Thirdly, Can you cleave cloſe to Jeſus Chriſt without wearineſs conſtantly? if you be off and on, if your way be uneven, it's a token you have little ſtrength.</item>
               <item>Fourthly, Are you able to do duties in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual manner? the ſpiritual performance of holy duties, argues the receiving of ſome ſpiritual ſtrength. By theſe and the like queſtions you may know, whether you have received ſome of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtrength, yea or no.</item>
            </list>
            <p>A ſecond uſe I ſhall make, it is by way of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Oh labour to read this Text experimentally: read it, I ſay, ſo as your own hearts may make a commentary on it: <hi>Oh Lord, thou haſt anſwered me; Lord, I can ſpeak by experience: I was as weak as water, but thou haſt ſtrengthened me with ſtrength in my ſoul: Whatever was written afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, was written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope.</hi> This inſtance of <hi>David</hi> was written for your imitation and conſolation. O labour for this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtrength. To preſs you to attain it, I ſhall uſe but this one motive:</p>
            <p>Conſider the great need you have of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtrength at all times, but eſpecially in times of general fears and dangers, then you have ſpecial need of it: In what regard, may be you will ſay, do we need ſo much ſtrength in our ſouls? I will tell you in theſe four reſpects eſpecially, or on this fourfold account:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, In regard of Duties that are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, In regard of Afflictions that are to be endured.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, In regard of the Enemies that are to be encountered.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45614:19"/>Fourthly, In regard of the danger of Apoſtacy that is to be prevented.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, You have great need of this ſpiritual ſtrength in regard of the Duties that are to be performed: Oh, a Chriſtian hath much work lying upon his hands in reference to eternity! a great work it is to provide oyl in your Lamps, grace in your hearts; a great work it is to get the hazzard of eternity o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to get an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, and to get an aſſurance of that intereſt. A great work it is for you to <hi>make your calling and election ſure,</hi> ſure to your own ſouls; to be <hi>working out your ſalvation with fear and trembling;</hi> a great work it is for you to be <hi>pondering the paths of your feet,</hi> to <hi>keep your hearts above all keepings; to be building up your ſelves in your moſt holy faith:</hi> Theſe are very great works. It is the language of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Jude, verſe</hi> 20 of his <hi>Epiſtle: But ye beloved, building up your ſelves in your moſt holy faith, praying in the holy Ghoſt;</hi> and to be <hi>preſſing forward towards the mark, for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 3.14. Nay, a Chriſtian hath yet a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der work than this to do: for a Chriſtian is to do that work that croſſes his own carnal and corrupt will. There are ſome difficult duties of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that are to be performed, as <hi>denying of our ſelves,</hi> a hard duty; the croſſing of our carnal and corrupt Affections, a hard duty; the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a beloved Luſt, a very hard duty; the pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a right eye: the cutting off of a right hand: a parting with a ſin that is as dear as our right hand, and our right eye, a difficult duty; ſo for a man to be crucifying the fleſh with the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Luſts thereof, to be contemning the world: to trample upon the pleaſures, the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45614:19"/>the blandiſhments of it; for a man to love his enemies, to pray for them that perſecute him, to do good to them that deſpitefully uſe him; How is it poſſible for a man to do all this work, a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult work, this work which ſo much croſſes his own carnal and corrupt frame, if he have not a conſiderable portion of ſpiritual ſtrength? A weak Chriſtian, alas, is offended with every thing, he is ready to ſtumble at every ſtraw: every duty is a burthen to him, every command of Chriſt ſeems grievous to him, every yoke of Chriſt he is not able to take upon his neck: it may be he may have ſome flaſhes of good deſires now and then, as <hi>Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi> had, <hi>Oh that I might die the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:</hi> It may be he may have ſome good purpoſes and reſolutions, as <hi>Saul</hi> had, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.21, <hi>Return my ſon David, for I will no more do thee harm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my ſoul was precious in thine eyes this days</hi> But all his purpoſes came to nothing. Nay, may be ſometimes he may have ſome endeavours, faint feeble endeavours, in the way of grace, juſt like the third ground in the Parable which wanted root; it brought forth indeed a blade, but it brought forth (the Text ſays) nothing to perfection. If a man be a weak Chriſtian, alas, it is very little that he can do in the buſineſs of Eternity. You have great need of ſtrength therefore in this regard.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You have great need of ſtrength in regard of the Afflictions, Temptations, Troubles, and Tryals that are to be endured. You have often heard, (and you will know it at one time or other; you will not believe us, but you will believe one day your own experience) <hi>That through many Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions you muſt enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12, <hi>Yea, and all that will live godly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45614:20"/>in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi> They muſt look for perſecution in one kind or other: <hi>And in the world you ſhall have tribulation,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: You muſt look for it, ſays he, if you be my diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 16.33. And ſays <hi>Luther, If thou beeſt not a Croſs-bearing Chriſtian, thou art no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indeed:</hi> How is it poſſible now for a man to climb this rocky way, if he hath not ſtrength? for the way to Heaven, is like the way that <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and his Armour-bearer had, in climbing up a great Rock: <hi>a ſharp rock was on the one ſide, and a ſharp rock was on the other ſide,</hi> 1 Sam. 14.4. How is it poſſible for a man to climb up this rocky way, if he have not ſome conſiderable ſtrength? If <hi>Stephen,</hi> for example, had not had a great meaſure of ſtrength, how could he have lookt upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors ſo chearfully in the midſt of all their threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, when they were ready to ſtone him? yet then <hi>they beheld his face, as if it had been the face of an Angel,</hi> Acts 6.15. And if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had not had conſiderable ſtrength, how could he have have ſaid, <hi>True, the holy Ghoſt witneſſeth that bonds and afflictions wait for me in every place, in every City where ever I go: but none of theſe things move me: neither count I my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the grace of God,</hi> Acts 20.23, 24. What a gallant anſwer was that which one made to <hi>Valentinian</hi> the <hi>Arrian Emperour,</hi> that threatned him with Bonds, Impriſonment, Baniſhment, and death? <hi>Tuſh,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Let him ſcare children with ſuch Bug-bears as theſe, he cannot ſcare me with them: he may take away my life, but he cannot take away my love to the truth;</hi> Here was a ſtrong Chriſtian.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45614:20"/>Now, I ſay, if a man have not a conſiderable ſtrength, how can he be able to bear all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that he may meet with? <hi>Can you drink of the cup</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>that I ſhall drink of? and be baptized with the baptiſm that I am bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with?</hi> Matth. 20.22. He ſpeaks there of the baptiſm of blood: Can you be baptized with this bloody baptiſm? can you be content to ſuffer for my ſake?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You have need of a great deal of ſtrength in your ſouls, in regard of the enemies that are to be encountred with: ſpiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, dangerous enemies, deadly implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For example now: One of the greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies you have to encounter with, is an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible enemy, namely, that <hi>Judas</hi> which you and I have in our hearts, the curſed corruption in our Natures, that works us more miſchief than either the World or the Devil: nay, then all the Devils in Hell can do. You ſee the whole world in a manner is ſubdued by this curſed enemy called Sin: the whole World almoſt is brought into bondage to it: and it is an enemy that you and I can never be rid of, until our bodies drop down into the duſt.</p>
            <p>Then you have a flattering and bewitching World, and the luſts and pleaſures of it are its baits: thoſe baits and allurements of it do ſo Lime-twigg the ſoul, it is not able to mount up: oh, how many are bewitched by it to their own deſtruction! <hi>Demas hath forſaken me, having lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this preſent World:</hi> and he loves it, becauſe it is preſent What is the reaſon of all the Apoſtacy, and Back-ſliding, and falling from the Profeſſion, and Principles, and Practice of Godlineſs, but only
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45614:21"/>the love of this preſent world: Men love the world becauſe it is preſent: they prefer a preſent poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, before a future expectation: Chriſts promiſe is for the future, You ſhall be happy hereafter: but ſay they, the world pays down upon the nail: You ſhall have it in hand, not in hope, ſays the world; If you can but lye, ſwear, and cog, and flatter, and temporize, and turn with every wind, ſaith the world, you ſhall have this preſerment. Now this is that which takes with many men: the World is ſuch an enemy, while it kiſſes, it kills: the World, like <hi>Dalilah,</hi> while it dandles you upon its lap, it betrays you to Satan. How many are there at this day, that will ſacrifice the peace of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? they will forſake, and loſe God and Chriſt, and heaven, and happineſs, and all, rather than they will part with their preſent enjoyments? Oh, that ſuch would conſider the pleaſures of ſin are but for a ſeaſon, but the puniſhments for ſin are for ever.</p>
            <p>Again, You have Satan to encounter with, who is an implacable enemy, a roaring Lion, that walks about ſeeking whom he may devour: and the dint of all his malice is againſt thoſe that deſire to walk moſt ſtrictly, moſt uprightly before God: for the greater part of the world, I mean them that are unregenerate, thoſe that are rockt aſleep in the Cradle of ſecurity, he never troubles them. When the ſtrong man armed keeps his Palace, all his goods are in peace. <hi>Satan</hi> never moleſts them: theſe are his own houſhold, under his own power: but the dint of all his malice is againſt thoſe that have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up their names to Jeſus Chriſt; and the more holy and heavenly-minded, and unblameable you deſire to be in your Converſations, the greater will be his rage and enmity againſt you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45614:21"/>Fourthly, Another Enemy you have to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with, and that is Death, the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, which is called the King of fears, and the fear of Kings: of all terribles the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, as the Philoſopher calls it. Now you have all theſe enemies to conquer: and how can you look the King of terrors in the face, if you have not this ſpiritual ſtrength?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, You have need of a great deal of ſtrength, in regard of the danger of Apoſtacy that muſt be prevented: Oh great, exceeding great, greater than I am able to tell you, is the danger of Apoſtacy! Oh that I could ſpeak it with all earneſtneſs, that if it might be, you might take heed of it; <hi>Thoſe that turn aſide to their crooked ways, the Lord ſhall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.</hi> Oh, they are loſt and undone for ever! <hi>Pſalm</hi> 125.5, <hi>And if any man draws back</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> A dreadful Scripture! which may make Apoſtates quake and tremble. God takes no pleaſure in ſuch as draw back; <hi>and it had been better for a man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have known the ways of God, than having known them, to turn aſide from the holy commandment.</hi> Its better to be an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> a <hi>Pagan,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> an <hi>Inſidel,</hi> any thing, rather than an <hi>Apoſtate?</hi> and they that ſhall put their hands to the Plow, and look back, are not fit for the Kingdom of God. Oh great is the danger of Apoſtacy! but now without ſome conſiderable ſtrength, you will not be kept from failing: and thoſe failings will turn to fallings: and thoſe fallings to fallings away, and at laſt falling into everlaſting deſtruction. Now theſe fallings, and fallings away, do uſually follow this want of ſpiritual ſtrength; not being ſtrengthened with ſtrength in our ſouls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:45614:22"/>But may be, you will ſay to me, What courſe muſt we take, that we may get this ſpiritual ſtrength in our ſouls? I anſwer briefly, make uſe of theſe rules and helps:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Be very ſenſible of your weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity: be humble, be baſe in your own eyes: be nothing in your ſelves, that you may be able to ſay, <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 45.24, It was a ſweet Meditation of Saint <hi>Auguſtin, Lord, I will be weak in my ſelf, that I may be ſtrong in thee.</hi> And the Apoſtle hath ſuch a phraſe: <hi>For when I am weak, then am I ſtrong,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10, that is, when I am moſt weak in my ſelf, then am I moſt ſtrong in a Saviour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you would have this ſtrength in your ſouls: be acting the Grace which you have received already; for action increaſeth ſtrength, and ſtrength will help action forwards: the more you are doing duty, the more will you gather ſtrength to do duty. It was the Motto of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divine in this Nation, now with God, <hi>The way to Holineſs, lyes in the works of Holineſs;</hi> ſo the way to get ſpiritual ſtrength, lyes in doing the work you have to do, with that ſtrength you have: uſe ſtrength, and you ſhall have more ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you would have ſtrength in your ſouls, grow eſpecially in corroborating and ſtrengthening Graces. What are thoſe ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Graces? 1. <hi>Faith,</hi> that is a very ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Grace: you read of the ſtrength of Faith: <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſtrong in Faith, and that made him do great things: that he could againſt hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in hope; that is, againſt hope of ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in hope of a promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. ſo be ſtrong
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45614:22"/>in <hi>Love,</hi> Love to Jeſus Chriſt. Love is a very ſtrengthening Grace, <hi>Love is ſtrong as death,</hi> Cant. 8.6, 7, Death, you know, is ſo ſtrong, that it hath conquered all men that ever were in the World: never was there any Gyant ſo ſtrong, but could be conquered by Death; there is no diſcharge in that War: the meaning is this: never any man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with Death that came off: but Love is ſtronger than Death. If thy heart be fired with Love to Jeſus Chriſt, it will carry you with a great deal of ſtrength through all difficulties, and ſufferings, with patience and perſeverance. 3. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Get more <hi>ſincerity; Job</hi> 17.9, <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous alſo ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger:</hi> Oh, the more ſincere you are, the more ſtrong you are: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Wherein conſiſts the ſtrenth of a Pillar? it is in the uprightneſs of it: if it begins to bow and bend, and be crooked, then it falls; but the uprightneſs of it is the ſtrength of it. 4. <hi>Joy;</hi> Joy, that is another ſtrengthening Grace, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.10, <hi>Neither be ye ſorry, for the joy of the Lord ſhall be your ſtrength.</hi> Oh, the more inward joy in the Holy Ghoſt you have, the more chearful you are; the more ſtrong you are: grow in theſe ſtrengthening Graces.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Would you have this ſtrength in your ſouls? then take heed of ruſhing into any known ſin: for ſin, as it wounds the conſcience, it weakens the ſoul alſo; ſins againſt conſcience, are like a thief in the Candle, which weakens our ſtrength, and waſts our joy. Nothing weakned <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſo much, as his ſporting with his <hi>Dalilah;</hi> Never had he loſt his ſtrength, had it not been for his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into that ſin: take heed therefore of ſins againſt conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:45614:23"/>Fifthly, If you would have ſtrength in your ſouls, take heed of evil company, ſhun them as a Peſt-houſe: for many times evil company weakens the ſoul more than any outward temptation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.115, <hi>Depart from me ye wicked, for I will keep the Commandements of my God.</hi> It is, as if he ſhould ſay, he could never ſet about the work of Obedience, ſo long as he kept company with the wicked.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you would have ſtrength in your ſouls, then get more intimate and boſom-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Jeſus Chriſt every day: for the truth is, all our ſtrength is from him; <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phil. 4.13. The more you are acquainted with Chriſt, the more will you have of this ſtrength which <hi>David</hi> here in the Text ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If you would have this ſtrength, be much in prayer: that is an excellent Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.28, <hi>My ſoul melteth away for heavineſs, ſtrengthen thou me according to thy word.</hi> Oh, the more we are in Prayer, and Care, and Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Humility, and Self-denial, and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Grace; the more we ſhall find our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtrength increaſed: then we ſhall experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſay with <hi>David, Thou haſt ſtrengthened me with ſtrength in my ſoul.</hi>

            <p>THE Apoſtle in the beginning of this Chapter, exhorting <hi>Timothy</hi> to a faithful diſcharge of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Calling, puts in this weighty caution, in the 8 verſe, <hi>Be not thou therefore aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord, nor of me his priſoner; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Goſpel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the power of God:</hi> that is, be not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Goſpel, that he calls there the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Lord Jeſus:</hi> Though it may be thou maiſt meet with afflictions, and oppoſitions in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45614:24"/>profeſſion of it, yet ſeeing theſe afflictions are but ſufferings for the Goſpel-ſake, therefore bear them patiently: it is better that thou ſhouldeſt ſuffer, than that the Goſpel ſhould ſuffer. This Caution, or Exhortation the Apoſtle preſſes from an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from the unſpeakable benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that comes ſtreaming to us by the Goſpel, namely, Eternal life; and that the Apoſtle might be rightly underſtood, he lays down the three cauſes of this Eternal life or Salvation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The principal and moving cauſe of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that is, the Grace of God, in the foregoing verſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with a holy calling: not according to our works, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He lays down the meritorious cauſe of our ſalvation, that is, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath merited this ſalvation by dying for us: in the middle part of the 10th verſe, <hi>who hath aboliſhed death,</hi> that is, who hath taken away the ſting and curſe of Death.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He lays down the inſtrumental cauſe of our ſalvation, that is the Goſpel, in the words that I have now read to you: <hi>And hath brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> Let me firſt unlock the Cabinet of the Text, and then ſhew you what treaſure is laid up in it: Briefly, <hi>He hath brought life.</hi>] As <hi>Calvin</hi> well obſerves upon the Text, It is an eminent and memorable Encomium of the Goſpel, that it brings life? and what life? not a temporal life, but an eternal life; therefore there is another weighty word added to expreſs it, <hi>life and immortality,</hi> or an immortal life; a life that is not capable of corruption; an incorruptible
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45614:24"/>life, that never ſhall have end; after as many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of years as there are drops of water in the Ocean, this eternal life and immortality ſhall be the ſame ſtill. He hath <hi>brought this life to light,</hi> the Text ſays; that is, He hath revealed it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it, although before it was, as it were, in the dark; it was a myſtery unknown to us: but now he hath revealed this myſtery, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the way to eternal life, and he hath revealed the unconceiveable joy and happineſs that is wrapt up in it; and all this is done by the Goſpel, the Text ſays: that is, by the preaching of the Goſpel; as is in the words following the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, <hi>Whereunto I am appointed a Preacher, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and a Teacher of the Gentiles.</hi> Now Goſpel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the acceptation of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Goſpel; that is, as if one ſhould ſay, a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that is, good news; that was the old antient word for good news. The glad tidings of ſalvation was ſuch a welcom meſſage, that it was fit for the mouth of an Angel to publiſh, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10, <hi>And the Angel ſaid unto them, Fear not: Behold, I do Goſpel you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all Nations:</hi> or I do preach the Goſpel, the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come meſſage of a Saviour being come into the World, by whom eternal ſalvation may be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So then the words being thus opened, the Doctrine I ſhall commend to you from them, ſhall be this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>The knowledg of eternal life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is diſcovered to the ſons of men by the preaching of the Goſpel.</hi> God <hi>bring life and immortality to light:</hi> he diſcovers it, reveals it; he makes it known: but how? ſays the Apoſtle, it is by the preaching of the Goſpel. I ſhall not need to travel far to fetch
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45614:25"/>in proof for this plain Doctrine: that Scripture is very remarkable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26, <hi>Now to him that is of power to ſtabliſh you, according to my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the preaching of Jeſus Chriſt, according to the revelation of the myſtery which was kept ſecret ſince the world began, but now is made manifeſt; and by the Scriptures of the Prophets, according to the commandment of the everlaſting God, made known to all Nations for the obedience of faith</hi> The Apoſtle ſays, The myſtery; that is, the myſtery of mans ſalvation: the myſtery of our redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, it was kept ſecret from the beginning of the World: but was now at laſt, ſays he, revealed by the Goſpel: the myſtery of mans ſalvation and redemption had been a claſped book for ever, if the Goſpel had not been a key to open it. What doth the Apoſtle mean by that Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4? <hi>But if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſi, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Whence it it men periſh in death and deſtruction? Whence is it they are loſt, quite loſt, and periſh without hope? ſurely, it is becauſe the Goſpel is hidden from them: either they want light, or elſe want ſight: though the Goſpel ſhines about them, it ſhines not unto them, into their hearts, to give them the knowledg of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt:</hi> a ſad ſpeech! Again, Whence is it ſo many glorious Titles are given to the Goſpel? for example, it is called <hi>the word of life,</hi> Phil. 2.16, <hi>Holding forth the word of life, that I may rejoyce in the day of Jeſus Chriſt, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45614:25"/>in vain.</hi> It is called <hi>the Goſpel of the Kingdom,</hi> Mat. 24.14, <hi>And this Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be preached to all the world for a witneſs unto all Nations, and then ſhall the end come.</hi> It is called <hi>the word of Gods grace:</hi>Acts 14.3, <hi>Long time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abode they ſpeaking boldly in the Lord, which gave teſtimony to the word of his grace, and granted ſigns and wonders to be done by their hands.</hi> And it is called <hi>the word of Reconciliation,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19, <hi>To wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</hi> Yea, it is called <hi>the word of Salvation, Acts</hi> 13.26. <hi>Men and Brethren, Children of the Stock of Abraham, and whoſoever among you feareth God: to you is the word of this ſalvation ſent.</hi> And it is called <hi>the Grace of God that bringeth ſalvation,</hi> Tit 2.11. Nay, yet more, it is called <hi>Salvation it ſelf:</hi> there cannot be a higher title given to it, than to call it <hi>Salvation it ſelf:</hi> In <hi>Acts</hi> 28.28, <hi>Be it known therefore unto you</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle, ſpeaking to thoſe ſtubborn Jews), <hi>That the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God is ſent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</hi> The Salvation of God, that is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, called there <hi>the Salvation of God,</hi> is ſent unto the Gentiles. All theſe titles ſufficiently clear this truth, That the knowledg of eternal Salvation is diſcovered by the Goſpel. Now for the better explication of this point, there are two <hi>Quaeries</hi> would be ſatisfied:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, How, or in what reſpect the knowledg of Salvation may be ſaid to be diſcovered by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel?</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Whether the knowledg of Salvation be diſcovered only by the Goſpel?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:45614:26"/>Firſt, How, or in what reſpect the knowledg of Salvation may be ſaid to be diſcovered by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? I anſwer in theſe three or four regards:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Goſpel is ſaid to reveal the knowledg of ſalvation, becauſe it reveals to us the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Author of this eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9, <hi>And being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he became the Author of eternal ſalvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all them that obey him.</hi> And he is called <hi>the rock of ſalvatiom,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.4. Deut. 32.15. And he is called a <hi>Horn of Salvation,</hi> Luke 1.69, <hi>And hath raiſed up an Horn of ſalvation for us in the houſe of his ſervamt David.</hi> In this regard the Goſpel may well be compared to the <hi>Star</hi> that led the wiſe men to Jeſus Chriſt: The Goſpel is that Star that leads us to the Day-ſpring from on high, to him that is the Morning-ſtar indeed, to him that is ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, cloathed in our fleſh.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Goſpel may be ſaid to reveal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in this regard, becauſe it is a means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the ſpirit of grace into the ſoul, who is the applier of this Salvation. Hence it is, the Goſpel is called <hi>the Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8, <hi>How ſhall not the miniſtration of the ſpirit be rather glorious?</hi> And you read in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44, that while <hi>Peter</hi> was preaching to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company, the Holy Ghoſt fell upon them: <hi>While Peter yet ſpake theſe words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the word:</hi> ſo that the Holy Ghoſt was diſpenced to them in the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Goſpel may be ſaid to reveal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in that it is an Inſtrument of begetting faith in the ſoul, which is the hand whereby we lay hold on this ſalvation: <hi>Faith comes by hearing of the Goſpel,</hi> Rom. 10.17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:45614:26"/>Fourthly, The Goſpel is ordained by God to be an Inſtrument of Regeneration, and Sanctification, and of Edification.</p>
            <p>Of Regeneration, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15, <hi>For though you have ten thouſand Inſtructors in Chriſt, yet have you not many Fathers: for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you through the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then it is the Inſtrument of our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too, in <hi>John</hi> 17.17, <hi>Sanctifie them by thy truth,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour), <hi>for thy word is truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is the Inſtrument of our Edification, or building us up in our moſt holy faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32, <hi>And now, Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace</hi> (that is, the Goſpel) <hi>which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them that are ſanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, if the Goſpel be the Inſtrument both of our Regeneration, Sanctification, and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it muſt needs be alſo the Inſtrument of our Salvation: that is for the firſt <hi>Quaery,</hi> How the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel may be ſaid to reveal Salvation? Becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Author of this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it is an Inſtrument of conveying the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace into the heart, who is the applier of this Salvation, and works faith, which is the hand whereby we lay hold on this Salvation: and it is the Inſtrument of working Regeneration, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Edification in us: and therefore muſt be the Inſtrument of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Quaery</hi> is this: But is the knowledg of Salvation revealed only by the Goſpel, may ſome ſay? Does not the Law alſo reveal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Does not the Law ſay, <hi>Do this, and live?</hi> To this I anſwer, Though the Law may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to reveal the knowledge of Salvation: Yet
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45614:27"/>there is a very great difference between the Laws revealing, and the Goſpels revealing it; and that in theſe two reſpects eſpecially: Firſt, the Law does not reveal the knowledg of ſalvation ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Secondly, The Law does not reveal the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Salvation ſo effectually.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Law does not reveal the knowledg of ſalvarion ſo clearly: for it reveals it only in types, and ſhadows, and reſemblances: therefore the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, <hi>The Law having the ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things.</hi> He compares the Law to a ſhadow; it had a ſhadow of good things to come: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, The Law told us indeed of a Saviour that was to come into the World, and the Law told us of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt; but it was typified in the multitude of thoſe bloody Sacrifices that were offered from day to day: and it told us of heaven, and the heavenly inheritance: but it was but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, it was ſhadowed out by an earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> or the Land of promiſe: whereas now the Goſpel brings in Jeſus Chriſt fully and clearly exhibited; it brings in Jeſus Chriſt as the Day-ſtar from on high, which does enlighten us, and the Son of Righteouſneſs that does diſpel all thoſe clouds and ſhadows that were in the Ceremonial Law: The Goſpel does, as it were, draw the Curtain, that now we may with <hi>open face behold as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. laſt verſe: therefore the Law does not diſcover the knowledg of ſalvation ſo clearly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Law does not diſcover the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Salvation ſo effectually: True, the Law hath told us of Salvation, but it doth not ſhew us the means whereby we may attain it: the Law ſhews us the way, but it does not help us to walk
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45614:27"/>in the way; the Law hath commanded us to obey, but it gives us no ſtrength to perform: therefore the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The Law was weak becauſe of our fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3, <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> Again, The Apoſtle tells us expreſly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19, <hi>The Law made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfect.</hi> The Law could never bring Man to Heaven; never was mortal man ſaved by the Law: It is true, indeed, it required obedience, but it gave us no ſtrength to perform that obedience: it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted obedience upon the penalty of a dreadful curſe, but it did not enable us to avoid that curſe; for its ſaid, <hi>Curſed be he that continueth not in all the words of this Law to do them,</hi> Deut. 27.26. And it's ſaid, <hi>the man that doth them, ſhall live in them, Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. I, but the Law gave no ſtrength to do what it did enjoyn: I, but now the Goſpel reveals the knowledg of Salvation more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually: becauſe, as it commands us to obey, ſo it gives us ſtrength to perform: the Law commands, but it is the Goſpel that helps us: How doth it help us? it helps us thus, Becauſe it directs us to Jeſus Chriſt by whom we may have ſtrength: <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 45.24. And ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phil. 4.13.</p>
            <p>I, but here it may be objected: Does not the Apoſtle ſay, That the Goſpel is <hi>the ſavour of death unto death,</hi> as well as <hi>the ſavour of life unto life?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. Now, if the Goſpel be the ſavour of death unto death, then how can it be ſaid to bring Eternal Salvation? To this I anſwer:</p>
            <p>When the Goſpel is ſaid to be the ſavour of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45614:28"/>death unto death, it is not ſpoken becauſe the Goſpel does kill and condemn ſimply. and in its own nature; but through the corruption of mens hearts that do not obey it, but do reject it, that do reſiſt it. A Kings pardon, you know, does not kill any by it ſelf, but by the contempt of a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor that does reject it; and ſo the pardon may double the Malefactors guilt, and bring upon him a more ſpeedy and fearful execution. So here, the Gracious pardon of God that is tendred in the Goſpel, does not kill, or condemn any in it ſelf, or in is own nature, but through the contempt of thoſe that do diſregard it: in this regard, not ſimply, but accidentally, through the corruptions of mens Hearts, and Natures; in this regard, the Goſpel may be ſaid to increaſe a mans curſe and condemnation: Whereas now the Law in its own nature is ſaid to be a killing Letter, becauſe it leaves a man in a ſtate of death, and leaves him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a curſe, and does not ſhew him the way at all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow to avoid that curſe, as the Goſpel does: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The Law is a killing Letter of it ſelf, but the Spirit giveth life,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. becauſe in the preaching of the Goſpel, the Spirit of God is conveyed into our ſouls, which enables us in ſome acceptable manner to perform what the Goſpel enjoyns: and thus you have the Point o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to you, That the knowledg of Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, that Eternal Salvation that is laid up for the Saints in light, is diſcovered and revealed by the Preaching of the Goſpel. For the Uſe of the Point now.</p>
            <p>And the firſt is by way of Information; and there are four Doctrinal Inferences, or Leſſons, that we may learn fron this point thus opened.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:45614:28"/>1. See how infinitely we ſtand indebted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to our gracious God, that hath lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us here in this Nation, and in this City; who hath brought us into the fellowſhip of th Goſpel, and hath kept us in that fellowſhip for ſo many years together. Oh, that we ſhould live under the ſhowres and Sun-ſhine of the glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, for almoſt a hundred years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without interruption! What a ſingular mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is this, if we did but know how to prize it? He hath ſcarce dealt ſo with any Nation under Heaven as he hath dealt with us: What did God ſee more in us than in <hi>Turks, Indians,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of God nor Goſpel? He foreſaw how we would deſpiſe this precious Pearl, and how we would be ready to trample it under foot: God foreſaw how weary we would be of thoſe glorious Goſpel-myſteries that are diſcovered to us from day to day: yet it did not hinder him from beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this precious Jewel upon us; therefore, not to us, not to us, but to his own Name be the Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Leſſon we may learn by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, is this: If the knowledg of eternal life be diſcovered in the Goſpel, then it follows, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God hath a Church planted, or a Church to be planted, there will ſtill be need of a powerful, quickning, ſoul-ſearching Miniſtry, for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and making known the Myſteries of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The publick preaching Miniſtry of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is that ſtanding Ordinance that muſt continue in the Church of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo long as he hath a Church here upon earth: and this appears by that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13, <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors; and Teachers, for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45614:29"/>the prefecting of the Saints. for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt,</hi> (How long? <hi>till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledg of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt:</hi> That is, to the end of the World: God will have a ſtanding Miniſtry, where-ever he hath a Church planted, or to be planted: God will have a Goſpel ſtanding Miniſtry, till all the Saints be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. If this be ſo, then how juſtly are they to be reproved, that think that a Goſpel-miniſtry, of all other things, may be beſt ſpared? if there be any ſuch here, mark what I ſay, You could ill want any of the four Elements, Earth, Air, Fire, or Water: You could ill want Salt, Bread, Drink, Cloathing: let me tell you, a Goſpel-miniſtry is as needful as any of theſe I have named: as Earth, Air, Fire, Water: as Salt, Bread, Drink, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for does not <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.18, <hi>Where there is no viſion, the people periſh?</hi> and would you have your ſouls periſh everlaſtingly? Is not our ſoul worth a whole World? It was a noble ſpeech of <hi>Luther, It were better that the whole World were in a Combuſtion and Confuſion, than that the Goſpel ſhould not be preached, or that any one ſoul that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be neglected.</hi> And it was ſpoken concerning <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Light in the Church, It was better that the Sun ſhould not ſhine, than that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſhould not preach: and it was a witty obſervation of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſpeaking concerning the beheading of <hi>John Baptiſt; Herod</hi> took off <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the promiſe he made to the Damoſel, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe ask'd him, to the half of his Kingdom, ſhould be granted; ſays that Father, ſpeaking of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45614:29"/>this paſſage, <hi>Herod</hi> might have kept his promiſe, though he had not taken off <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> head: for he promiſed the Damoſel, to give her to the half of his Kingdom; But now, ſays he, <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> head was worth a whole Kingdom. Pray tell me, you that have ſlight thoughts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, or of a Goſpel-miniſtry, Does not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture compare Miniſters to Planters, to Builders, to Fathers, to Remembrancers, to Stars, to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guides, and to a City upon a Hill, and the like? If ever you be trees of Righteouſneſs in Gods Garden, it is a Miniſtry that hath planted you: and if ever you be ſpiritual ſtones in Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Building, it muſt be the Miniſtry muſt build you: if ever you be Sons and Daughters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to eternal Life, it is the Miniſtry muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get you, <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15, ſays the Apoſtle; and if ever your ſeet be guided into the way that leads into everlaſting life, it is a Goſpel-miniſtry muſt guide you: and if ever you be led to Jeſus Chriſt, as the <hi>Wiſe-men</hi> were by the Star in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> when Chriſt was born in <hi>Betlehem,</hi> it muſt be theſe ſpiritual Stars that are in the firmament of Gods Church that muſt lead you. Now judg in your ſelves therefore, whether a Goſpel-miniſtry can be ſpared?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Doctrinal inference is this; If the knowledg of eternal Salvation comes by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, then it teacheth us this Leſſon alſo; How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely it does concern us to prize, and fruitfully to improve our Goſpel-ſeaſons, thoſe opportunities God puts into our hands for the enriching of our ſouls: but eſpecially, we ſhould improve our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day opportunities, becauſe Sabbaths are the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45614:30"/>Market-days of Eternity, the Markets wherein we muſt make proviſion for Eternity: Oh, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhould we be to improve theſe Goſpel-ſeaſons! Let me tell you, Goſpel-ſeaſons are very precious ſeaſons, becauſe marvellous precious things are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to you in the preaching of the Goſpel; more precious than all the Gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than all the Kingdoms of the World, if they were in your own power: for in the preaching of the Goſpel, a precious Chriſt, who is the Pearl of price, worth ten thouſand thouſand Worlds, and more worth: this precious Chriſt, this Pearl of Price may now be obtained: and a precious Covenant, a Covenant made between God and the ſoul, this precious Covenant may now be confirmed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Evidences of Eternal Salvation may be now gained; and likewiſe precious Graces, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Faith, and precious Hope, and precious Love, Humility, Repentance, and Self-denial: theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Graces may be now procured; a precious ſoul may be ſaved, a precious pardon may be ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Oh, what precious things then are tendred to you in the preaching of the Goſpel! theſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities therefore are exceeding precious: if Chriſt be thine now, he is thine for ever; Oh, that you you did but know the price of theſe things that are tendred to you in the preaching of the Goſpel! if a condemned priſoner did know how precious the pardon that was brought to him was, would he ſlight it? Here is a precious Pardon, Grace, Mercy, Peace, all tendred to you in the preaching of the Goſpel. How infinitely then does it concern us to improve our Goſpel-ſeaſons?</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Leſſon by way of inference, is this, It lets us ſee the contempt, nay, the neglect
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45614:30"/>of the Goſpel, is a very dangerous ſin; for if the knowledg of Salvation be brought to the ſoul by the Goſpel, then certainly he that neglect the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, neglects Salvation, and Salvation it ſelf ſhall not ſave that man that deſpiſeth the remedy, yea, that neglects Salvation; ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> Heb. 2.3, As if he had ſaid, It is impoſſible to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape eternal Damnation, if we do but neglect this eternal Salvation: Theſe are the Leſſons from this Doctrine, and that's the firſt Uſe, of Information.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Uſe I ſhall make of this Doctrine, it is for Examination: If ſo be the knowledg of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life be brought by the Goſpel, be diſcovered, and revealed by the Goſpel: then take occaſion to call your ſelves to an account, and ſee whether this eternal Salvation be ſo diſcovered to you, that you may be partakers of it; otherwiſe, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage will it be to you, to hear that Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality is brought to light, unleſs this Light do ſhine into your ſouls? But may be you will ſay to me, How may we do to know that the Day-ſpring from on High, hath ſhined into my ſoul? that God hath called me out of darkneſs into his marvellous Light? that he hath diſcovered the Myſteries of Salvation to me, even to me?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, You may know it briefly thus: If the Light of Life be revealed to thy Soul, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy knowledg will not be a Notional knowledg only, but an Experimental knowledg; thou wilt not have a knowledg ſwimming in thy head only, but a ſoaking, and ſinking knowledg in thy heart: thou wilt not only know Chriſt, but taſte Chriſt; thou wilt taſte that hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> Rev. 2.17, <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45614:31"/>Manna.</hi> Thou wilt not only know, but taſte the bitterneſs of ſin: and thou wilt ſay, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19, <hi>It is an evìl and bitter thing that I have for ſaken the Lord, and that his fear is not in me.</hi> A blind man may talk of Colours that never ſaw them, and a hungry man may talk of a full dinner that never taſted it: ſo a carnal man may have a great deal of knowledg in his head, and never relliſh nor taſte it: but he that hath the knowledg of Salvation reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his ſoul, he hath a Light ſhining in his heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34, <hi>And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: for they ſhall know me from the leaſt of them, unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord;</hi> that is, they ſhall not need to be taught thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental truths that are written in their own hearts, by the finger of the Spirit of God. A man that hath this Life and Immortality brought to light by the Goſpel, will ſay, You need not tell me that ſin is a bitter thing, I have taſted the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; You need not tell me, the favour of God is ſweet and lovely; Oh, it is ſweeter to me than life it ſelf; You need not tell me that Jeſus Chriſt is very Amiable and Beautiful, I ſee him to be ſo with my eye of faith; You need not tell me, there is a marvellous power in the death of Chriſt for the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of ſin, I do experimentally know it: when a man hath this experimental knowledg, he will ſay as the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, <hi>I was before a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, and a Perſecutor, and injurious, but I obtained Mercy becauſe I did it ignorantly.</hi> When a man hath the feeling and experience of ſpiritual Truths in his own ſoul, then may he be ſure that Life and Immortality is brought to light by the Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45614:31"/>A third Uſe I ſhall make of this Doctrine, it is of Reproof: Two ſorts there are, that are juſtly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the reproof of this Doctrine. Firſt, It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns and crys down that Helliſh practice of the whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popiſh Clergy, who lock up the Scriptures, and keep Millions of ſouls from the knowledg of Goſpel, from the knowledg of the myſteries of Salvation; this is all one, as if they ſhould lock them up in the pit of Infernal darkneſs: for if ſo be Salvation, or Eternal Life be brought to light by the Goſpel, and this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel be to them but as a Light in a dark Lanthorn, muſt not they needs inevitably periſh? Oh cruel bloody Butchers! Oh mercileſs miſchievous Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroyers! may we ſay of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Synagogue: well may the whore of <hi>Rome</hi> be ſaid to be drunk with blood, becauſe ſhe is drunk not only with the blood of the bodies of Men, but with the blood of the Souls of men. Oh, the tender Mercies of God that hath opened our eyes to ſee better things, and to free us from the bondage and ſlavery of that Antichriſtian yoke: this is a great mercy to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the poyſon of thoſe ſerpents, and a greater mercy than ever we can be thankful for. But take this withal, I beſeech you, Take heed that Popery do not creep in at a back-dore of Toleration: let us bleſs God for that liberty that we have; but take heed that you do not hanker after thoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Doctrines that may poyſon the ſoul, and that will provoke God to remove his Candleſtick from amongſt us.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſort to be reproved, are thoſe that grow weary of the Goſpel: I, but may be you will ſay, Are there any ſo bad in our days, as to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpel? yea, my brethren, many there
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45614:32"/>are that are weary of the Truths of it: many that are weary of the Profeſſion of it, many that are weary of the Power and Practiſe of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Many there are that are weary of the Truths of the Goſpel, that chuſe rather to be raking in the ſtinking puddles of Popery, Arminianiſm, Socinianiſm, and other damnable hereſies, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls them; they chuſe theſe rather than the clear fountain of truth revealed in the Goſpel: Oh, theſe are in a very dangerous condition, when men chuſe rather to be Maſters of new opinions, than to be diſciples of old Truths: theſe men may be ſaid to be weary of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Are there not ſome that are weary of the Profeſſion of the Goſpel? ſuch as are Atheiſts, and prophane Libertines, Swearers, Drunkards, and others of that Gang, that could be contented that the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould be extinguiſhed, that the Candle might be put out, ſo they may but ſin more freely: but our Saviour hath read their doom, <hi>John</hi> 3.19, <hi>This is the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Are there not ſome weary of the Power and Practice of the Goſpel? ſuch are Hypocrites, Apoſtates, luke-warm Profeſſors, and carnal Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, that have (it is true) a form of godlineſs, but are as far from the power and practice of it, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans are from the profeſſion of it: Are not theſe worthy think you to be reproved? yea, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them, and his Word reproves them, and their own conſciences will one day reprove them: nay, that Goſpel which now they deſpiſe and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, will then arraign, indict, and condemn them,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45614:32"/>at that great day: for if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will come in flames of fire, to take vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not his Goſpel, as it is 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8, What will become of them that are weary of it, that deſpiſe it, that do underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it?</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Uſe (to ſhut up this point), is this, If the knowledg of ſalvation be diſcovered by the preaching of the Goſpel; then let me preſs upon you three very neceſſary and ſeaſonable Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Learn to prize the Goſpel while you have it: labour to know the worth of it now you have it, leſt God let you ſee the worth of it in the want of it, when it is too late: God will never hang a Jewel upon a ſwines ſnout; God will never long continue the Goſpel in mercy to a People that do not value it. True indeed, ſome there are that are ready to ſay of the Goſpel, as <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> in like caſe; <hi>Are not Abana and Pharphar, rivers of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, better than all the waters of Iſrael? may I not waſh in them to be clean?</hi> So ſome will ſay, Are not the doctrines of Popery, and other corrupt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, better than all the doctrines of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? But I hope you have not ſo learnt Chriſt: Oh, learn to prize the Goſpel as the doctrine of your ſalvation, as the evidence of your inheritance; Do you learn to prize it as the tree of life, which is for the healing of the Nations, as the pledg of the hope you have of eternal life? Labour for ſuch an eſteem of the Goſpel as <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.111, <hi>Thy teſtimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever, for they are the rejoycing of my heart:</hi> Oh, do you now learn to prize the Goſpel as the greateſt privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that ever God did beſtow upon you next to Jeſus Chriſt, and his Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:45614:33"/>A ſecond Duty I would preſs upon you, is this, not only to prize the Goſpel, but to make uſe of it, and improve it for your own ſpiritual advantage: <hi>Yet a little while</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>is the light with you: walk while you have the light, leſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs come upon you; for he that walketh in darkneſs, knoweth not whither he goeth, John</hi> 12.35. Oh, that you and I could learn to make hay while the Sun ſhines! Oh, that we could improve theſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities while we do enjoy them! If ſo be the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſhould be taken away from you, before your peace is made with God, before you have gotten Jeſus Chriſt into your hearts; before the Covenant between God and your Souls be ſealed; Oh, how ſad and doleful would your conditions be! ſure I am, we were never in ſo much danger of loſing the Goſpel as at this day, for our barrenneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs, and wearneſs of the Goſpel. We are ready to ſay, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13, <hi>What a wearineſs is it to ſerve the Lord?</hi> and for our contempt of the means of grace. Now if ſuch a day ſhould come as God threatens, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.6, <hi>Therefore night ſhall be unto you, that ye ſhall not have a viſion, and it ſhall be dark unto you, that ye ſhall not divine: and the Sun ſhall go down over the Prophets, and the day ſhall be dark over them.</hi> If ſuch a day ſhould come as God threatens, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11, <hi>Behold, the days come ſaith the Lord God, that I will ſend a famine in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirſt for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord: And they ſhall wander from ſea to ſea, and from the North even to the Eaſt: they ſhall run to and fro to ſeek the word of the Lord, and ſhall not find it:</hi> Oh, what a black, doleful, diſmal day would this be!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It ſhould teach us to walk worthy of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45614:33"/>the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27, <hi>Only let your converſation be as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> Oh, let us learn to lead Goſpel-lives under Goſpel-light; let it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſaid to us, that the Goſpel is a grace to us, but we are a diſgrace to the Goſpel; I beſeech you, my brethren, ſtudy to live up to your light: ſeeing God hath called you out of darkneſs into his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light, <hi>walk as children of the light:</hi> follow that golden Rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8, <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report: if there be any virtue, and if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things,</hi> ſpeak of theſe things: Oh, could we but once learn to caſt off the works of darkneſs, and to put on the armour of light; could we once be brought to this, to repent of our Goſpel-ſins, may be the Lord may lengthen our tranquility: may be God may revive his work in the midſt of our days: may be glory may yet dwell in our Land, and make us a name and praiſe throughout the whole earth: But if we go on in a courſe of Rebellion; if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt the light; if we deſpiſe the means of grace; if we undervalue thoſe precious ſeaſons of Salvation that are tendred to us; if we grieve the holy Spirit of God from day to day, and cauſe him to withdraw from us; what a black and doleful day may ſeize upon us! The Lord work theſe things upon every one or our hearts, that ſtill the Goſpel in its power and purity may be continued to us.</p>

            <p>THE firſt verſe of this Chapter will tell you what the ſcope of the Chapter is; namely, to ſpeak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the poor captive <hi>Jews</hi> in their return from <hi>Babylon:</hi> and the comfort that is here proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it is derived from a double Spring: 1. From the Promulgation of the Goſpel. 2. From the coming of Jeſus Chriſt in the Fleſh, who is the Marrow of the Goſpel. 1. From the Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, and that is amplified two ways: from the Herald that Proclaims it, and by the Place where it was proclaimed. 1. By the Herald that proclaimed it: namely, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, called the voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, Prepare
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45614:34"/>ye the way of the Lord, make ſtraight in the deſart a way for our God.</hi> 2. It is amplified by the place where it ſhould be proclaimed, namely, in <hi>Sion,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> in the 9th verſe, <hi>O Sion that bringeſt good tidings, get thee up into the high Mountain: O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, that bringeſt good tidings, lift up thy voice with ſtrength: lift it up, be not afraid; ſay to the Cities of Judah, behold your God.</hi> Then Chriſts coming in the fleſh, that is deſcribed two ways: 1. By his Terrour to his Enemies. 2. By his mild carriage and behaviour towards his own People. By his Terrour towards his Enemies, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſe, the 10th ver. <hi>Behold, the Lord will come with a ſtrong hand, and his Arm ſhall rule for him: behold his reward is with him, and his work before him.</hi> Then he is deſcribed here by his meek and mild carriage towards his People, in the words I have read unto you, <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let me firſt open the terms of the Text, and then come to ſome points of Inſtruction: <hi>He ſhall feed.</hi> The Government of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Church, and towards his Choſen, is expreſt by three names: He is call'd a Ruler, a Leader, and a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd. He is called a Ruler <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in <hi>Micah</hi> 5.2, <hi>But thou Beth-leem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be Ruler in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, whoſe goings forth have been from of old, from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting.</hi> Now Jeſus Chriſt rules three ways: 1. By his Commanding-power. 2. By his Compelling-power. 3. By his Perſwading-power. He hath a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding-power, <hi>All power is given to me in Heaven and Earth,</hi> Matth. 18.35. He hath a Compelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power, <hi>Thoſe mine enemies which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither and ſlay them
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45614:35"/>before me,</hi> Luk. 19.27. Then he hath likewiſe a Perſwading-power, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27, <hi>God ſhall perſwade Japhet, and he ſhall dwell in the Tents of Shem.</hi> 2dly, His Government is expreſt by this Name, <hi>He is a Leader to his people.</hi> Now Chriſt is a Leader to his People three ways: 1. By teaching of his people: his very enemies did acknowledg it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.14, <hi>We know thou teacheſt the way of God in truth.</hi> He teacheth them by going before them in a way of good example, <hi>John</hi> 13.15, <hi>I have given you an example, that you ſhould do as I have done.</hi> He leads them likewiſe by drawing of them, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> Then, as he is a Ruler, and a Leader, ſo he is a Shepherd: his Government is compriſed under this Name, <hi>He ſhall feed his Flock like a Shepherd.</hi> And here in the Text, where under the name of <hi>Feeding,</hi> is compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the neceſſary attendances and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that conduce to the ſafety and welfare of the Flock; ſuch as providing of them Paſture, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting of them from the danger and miſchief of Wolves and Lyons, and Beaſts of Prey; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in preventing their ſtragling and wandring in the Wilderneſs: And in curing of thoſe Diſeaſes that are incident to Sheep: All theſe are meant by <hi>Feeding.</hi> Oh, the Richneſs, and Compleatneſs of this precious Redeemer! well may the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>He is able to ſave to the utmoſt thoſe that come to God by him.</hi> And well may the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Chriſt is all and in all,</hi> becauſe he is both the Ruler, Leader, and Shepherd; the Prince and Captain of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Saviour, and all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſhall gather his Lambs with his Arms.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a tender care of all his Sheep, that none of them be loſt, as he ſays in that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45614:35"/>Heavenly Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17.11, <hi>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy Name: thoſe that thou gaveſt me I have kept, and none of them is loſt, but the Son of Perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</hi> I, but he hath the moſt tender and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful compaſſion towards thoſe that are his Lambs, that is, young Beginners, Babes in Chriſt, thoſe he gathers in his Arms: ſo the Text tells us, thoſe he <hi>carries in his boſom;</hi> that is, he deals favourably with them; thoſe he cheriſhes with all indulgence; <hi>He does not quench the ſmoaking flax, nor break the bruiſed read,</hi> Matth. 12.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then he gently leads thoſe that are with young, or thoſe that give ſuck;</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies both. either thoſe that are with young, or thoſe that give ſuck. The Prophet here in the Text alludes to the manner of <hi>Jacobs</hi> dealing with his Flocks; See what a compaſſionate man that good man was, as you may read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.13, <hi>The flocks and the herds that are with young, they are with me: and if men ſhould over-drive them but one day, all the flocks would dye.</hi> What a care had <hi>Jacob</hi> of all his flocks, eſpecially of thoſe that were with young! ſo the Lord Chriſt he gently leads thoſe that are with young; that is, weak Chriſtians, ſuch as are eaſily offended, ſuch as are dejected, and diſcouraged; ſuch as are full of infirmities and imperfections, he gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leads them; that is, he exerciſes a great deal of pity, and patience, and compaſſion, and tenderneſs towards them; <hi>In all their afflictions he is afflicted with them,</hi> Iſa. 63.9. He hath Sympathizing Bowels towards thoſe that are full of Infirmities: his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are troubled as it were for them; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20, <hi>Is Ephraim a dear Son? is he a pleaſant Child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45614:36"/>him ſtill, therefore my Bowels are troubled for him; I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord:</hi> So that here is gentleneſs in bearing with them, and patience in ſuffering of them: In a word, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is a meek, a gentle, a mild, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Saviour, that is the ſum of the whole verſe; he is of a very ſweet, amiable, pliable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: As God hath fitted him with a Body, ſo he hath fitted him with a Heart to be a merciful and compaſſionate Redeemer. The words being thus opened, there are two things in them eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented to your view: 1. Chriſts relation to his People. 2dly, His mild carriage towards them in that relation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſts relation to his People, that you have in theſe words, <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a Shepherd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, You have his Meek, Mild, and Gracious carriage towards them; he does both Protect them, and Feed them, and Pity them, and gathers them in his Arms, and carries them in his Boſom, and gently Leads them; and accordingly there are theſe two Points of Doctrine that are moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and clearly held forth in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 1.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt is that Bleſſed Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, that is able both to feed and protect his People here, and to give them eternal Life hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 2.</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards his People, hath a tender reſpect to their Infirmities.</p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt Doctrine: The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is that bleſſed Shepherd that is abundantly able to feed and protect his People here, and to give them eternal life hereafter.</p>
            <p>For the proof of this Doctrine, take two or three Scriptures, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.11, <hi>I am the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45614:36"/>the good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep:</hi> and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20, He is called the great Shepherd of the Sheep, <hi>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> And he is called the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and Biſhop of our ſouls,</hi> in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, <hi>For ye were as ſheep going aſtray, but are now returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Shepherd and Biſhop of our ſouls:</hi> ſo that doubtleſs, Jeſus Chriſt is the moſt bleſſed, the beſt, the greateſt, the ſweeteſt Shepherd that ever was, as will appear by theſe four reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, Becauſe he hath the greateſt care over them.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Becauſe he hath the greateſt love to his Sheep.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, Beeauſe he hath the greateſt power that ever Shepherd had.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, Becauſe he hath the greateſt reward for them that can poſſibly be beſtowed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt hath the greateſt care over his Sheep; for he ſeeks them when they are loſt: <hi>I come,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to ſeek and to ſave thoſe which were loſt.</hi> Luk. 1.9, 20, <hi>For the Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> And he gathers them from the ends of the world, he fetches them from all corners of the earth; there is not one of his ſheep, that is, not one that belongs to the election of grace, but in what <hi>place</hi> ſoever he be, though among Pagans, Heathens, and Infidels; of what <hi>condition</hi> ſoever he be, whether high or low, rich or poor, noble or ignoble, of what <hi>calling</hi> or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment ſoever: As ſome will be ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and ſay, I am lockt up under a Calling, I would be better if my Calling would let me: I,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45614:37"/>but there is not one of Chriſts ſheep that belongs to the election of Grace, though he be lockt up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Calling, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will ſeek him out in what condition or Calling ſoever he be. That's the firſt reaſon, He hath the greateſt care over his ſheep, to gather them into his Fold.</p>
            <p>2dly, Becauſe he hath the greateſt love to his ſheep, ſuch love as the like was never heard of: <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend,</hi> John 15.13. There cannot be greater love manifeſted than this: but ſuch love hath the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he hath laid down his life, that good Shepherd laid down his life for his ſheep, as in the forenamed place, <hi>John</hi> 10.11, <hi>I am the good Shepherd, the good Shepherd giveth his life for the ſheep.</hi> You know <hi>Jacob</hi> ſheweth a great deal of love to his ſheep, in that (as he tells you) <hi>he was in the day-time parched with heat, the drought conſumed him: and in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time pinched with froſt:</hi> and he broke his ſleep many times to watch his ſheep, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.40, <hi>My ſleep,</hi> ſays he, <hi>departed from mine eyes.</hi> That was great love; but <hi>David</hi> ſhewed greater love to his Flocks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.70, <hi>he followed the Ewes great with young,</hi> when God took him from the Sheepfolds to wield the Scepter. And he ſhewed yet greater love to his Flock, as he tells you in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.34, 35, <hi>And David ſaid unto Saul, Thy ſervant kept his Fathers ſheep, and there came a Lion and a Bear, and took a Lamb out of the ſtock, and I went out after him, &amp; ſmote him, delivered it out of his mouth; and when he aroſe againſt me, I caught him by his beard, and ſmote him, and ſlew him; thy ſervant ſlew both the Lion and the Bear: David</hi> ventured very far, he ventured
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45614:37"/>his life for one Lamb of the Flock; but Jeſus Chriſt, that bleſſed Shepherd, did not only venture his life, but he laid down his life for his ſheep; and he did not venture to grapple with an ordinary Lion, but with <hi>that roaring Lion that walks about ſeeking whom he may devour:</hi> Nay, he did not only wreſtle with that roaring Lion, but with all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>he wreſtled with principalities and powers;</hi> Nay, he wreſtled with the wrath of a ſin-revenging God, and all that he might ſave his poor ſheep: therefore never was there ſuch a loving Shepherd as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. That's the ſecond reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He hath the greateſt power and ability that ever Shepherd had; for this is extraordinary, that he <hi>makes</hi> all the ſheep he hath: all his ſheep are the workmanſhip of his hands, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 100.3, <hi>Know ye that the Lord he is God, it is he that hath made us, and not we our ſelves: we are his people, and the ſheep of his paſture.</hi> He hath that power that he can do whatſoever pleaſeth him in heaven and in earth: <hi>All power in heaven and carth is given to him,</hi> Matth. 26.18. He hath that power that he is able to deliver his ſheep from the gates of hell; He hath ſaid, <hi>that the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt them,</hi> Matth. 16.18. He hath that power that he can do that for his ſheep that all the world, and all the Princes in the world cannot do for them; and therefore he muſt needs be the beſt Shepherd That's the third reaſon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He hath the greateſt reward alſo to beſtow upon every one of his ſheep: Alas! his ſheep give nothing to him: <hi>My goodneſs does not extend to thee,</hi> Pſalm 16.2. We can beſtow nothing upon this bleſſed Shepherd, he hath no need of any thing we have; I, but he beſtows a very rich por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45614:38"/>upon his ſheep, a glorious reward: he feeds them, he cloaths them, he protects them here in this world, and gives them eternal life hereafter.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This bleſſed Shepherd feeds all his ſheep; he feeds them firſt by his Word, and then by his Sacraments.</p>
            <p>He feeds them by his Word, by ſending his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers as under-Shepherds to feed his Flock: It is a Goſpel-promiſe, that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15, <hi>I will give you Paſtors according to my own heart, which ſhall feed you with knowledg and underſtanding.</hi> And it was one end of our Saviours aſcention into Heaven, and a great bleſſing we have by it; he aſcended into heaven that he might give giſts unto men, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8, 11, 12, 13 verſes; <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, when he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men; and he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts; and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the ſaints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</hi> He gave gifts to men: he did not only give extraordinary gifts, ſuch as Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts; but ordinary gifts to Paſtors and Teachers, for the building up of his own body.</p>
            <p>And as he feeds his ſheep with his Word, ſo with his Sacraments: and here is ſuch feeding as you did never hear the like; for this bleſſed Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd feeds his ſheep with his own fleſh and blood, his own fleſh that was crucified to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice; and his own blood that was ſhed to quench the fire of Gods wrath that was kindled againſt them: this is that our Saviour tells you of in <hi>John</hi> 6.51, <hi>I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45614:38"/>for ever: and the bread which I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> And in <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5, <hi>He hath loved us, and waſht us from our ſins in his blood.</hi> As they ſay of the Pelican, when her young ones are ready to die, ſhe opens her breaſt with her bill, and feeds them with her blood; ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt feeds every one of his ſheep with his fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p>Again, He feeds the ſouls of his ſheep with the graces of his own bleſſed Spirit: as Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Love, Humility, Sincerity, and the like, which are ſpiritual food, ſuitable to the ſpiritual nature of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>So he feeds his ſheep with the Promiſes, which are ſaid to be breaſts of conſolation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.11, <hi>That ye may ſuck and be ſatisfied with the breaſts of conſolation: that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</hi> With the breaſts of conſolation, that is, with the precious promiſes. And this is that which that good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> intended in that ſpeech of his, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.16, <hi>Oh Lord, by theſe things men live: and in all theſe things is the life of my ſpirit: ſo wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.</hi> Theſe precious promiſes made good to my ſoul, by theſe do men live, and theſe are the life of my Spirit. Thus you ſee, how this bleſſed Shepherd feeds his Sheep. But yet more: He does not only feed his Sheep, but he gives them Stomachs alſo; look as it is in point of knowledg, we are not able to ſee him of our ſelves, we cannot ſee him without him, for he is our Light: and as in point of performance, we are not able to believe on him, nor come unto him without him, for he is our ſtrength: ſo here, neither can we feed on Jeſus Chriſt, nor the promiſes, nor the graces of his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45614:39"/>Spirit, until he gives us a mouth to taſte theſe things; therefore the Apoſtle exhorts us, <hi>as new-born Babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the word that we may grow thereby; if ſo be we have taſted that the Lord is gracious;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, You cannot feed, unleſs you have taſted of this bleſſed Saviour, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As he feeds, ſo he cloaths his Sheep; here amongſt men the Sheep cloaths the Shepherd, the Fleece of the ſheep cloaths the Shepherd: But here, this bleſſed Shepherd cloaths every one of his Sheep; he cloaths them with coſtly raiment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Ezck.</hi> 16.10, 11, 12, <hi>I cloathed thee alſo with broidered work, and ſhod thee with Badgers skin, and I girded thee about with fine linnen, and I covered thee with Silk; I decked thee alſo with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a Chain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy neck, and I put a Jewel on thy forehead, and ear-rings in thine ears, and a beautiful Crown upon thy head; thus waſt thou decked with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and thy rayment was of fine Linnen, and Silk; and broidred work.</hi> Therefore it is that you read that the Apoſtle bids us to <hi>put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 13.14. He cloaths us with the Robe of his own Righteouſneſs: <hi>He covers us with the garments of Salvation; as a Brridegroom decketh himſelf with Ornaments, and as a Bride adorneth her ſelf with her Jewels,</hi> Iſa. 61.10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He does protect his Sheep, and watcheth over them from Morning to Evening: he hath his eye continually upon them: therefore <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the Lord being his Shepherd; then ſays he, <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy Rod and thy Staff they comfort me,</hi> Pſal. 23.4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:45614:39"/>Fourthly and laſtly, He gives to his Sheep Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, <hi>John</hi> 10.28, <hi>And I give unto my Sheep E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have the Point opened, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is that Bleſſed Shepherd, who is abundantly able to feed and protect his People here, and to give them Eternal Life hereafter,</hi> becauſe he hath the greateſt Care over them, the greateſt Love to them, the greateſt Power that ever Shepherd had, and the greateſt Reward to give them that can poſſibly be beſtowed.</p>
            <p>Now for the Uſes of this Point, and they are three, by way of Inſtruction, Examination or Tryal, and Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Inſtruction: Oh, ſee the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Happy, the Comfortable Condition of all thoſe that have a part and intereſt in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, this Bleſſed Shepherd! what tongue of Men or Angels is able to expreſs the happy and bleſſed condition of that man that hath gotten Jeſus Chriſt for his Portion! ſuch a one ſhall be ſure of Food, of Cloathing, of Protection, of Joy, of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, of Happineſs, of Eternal Life, and what not? Oh, how may that ſoul dance for joy, that hath gotten Jeſus Chriſt to be his Shepherd! ſurely it is a comfortable and heart-chearing meditation in theſe turbulent and ſtormy times, when the Church of God hath ſo many enemies, and ſo ſew friends; when the Antichriſtian Faction roars againſt the little Flock of this bleſſed Shepherd, like ſo many Bears to devour them; here is the comfort, Jeſus Chriſt ſticks as cloſe to his Flock, as ever <hi>David</hi> did to his Flock, when the Lyon and the Bear came to make a prey of them: <hi>Fear not little Flock</hi> (ſays
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45614:40"/>our Saviour) <hi>it is your Fashers good pleaſure to give you a Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12.32. As he ſaid when he was ſailing in the Boat with <hi>Ceſar,</hi> the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beginning to be afraid becauſe of the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuouſneſs of the waters, Fear not man, thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt <hi>Ceſar</hi> and all his Fortunes with him; ſo may it be ſaid of every one that hath Jeſus Chriſt in the Boat with him, Let him not fear: true indeed, the Ship wherein Chriſt and his Sheep are, may be toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but it can never be over-turned, becauſe the Shepherd and Pilot are in it; therefore, happy is the condition of all thoſe that have an intereſt in this Bleſſed Shepherd. But on the contrary, Oh, the deplorable and deſperate condition of all thoſe that have not Jeſus Chriſt for their Shepherd! what are they think you? they are juſt in ſuch a caſe as God threatneth <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.14, God ſays, <hi>that Babylon ſhall be as the chaſed Roe, and as a Sheep that no man taketh up.</hi> This is the caſe of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is yet out of Chriſt, expoſed to be a prey to that roaring Lyon that walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour; thoſe that have not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, God threatens them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.16, <hi>I will feed them as a Lamb in a large place: I will feed them,</hi> the ſame <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to <hi>feed,</hi> ſignifies to <hi>let them wander,</hi> Num. 14.33, <hi>God let the children of Iſrael wander in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for forty years together:</hi> So God lets thoſe that have not an intereſt in Chriſt, to wander in the Wilderneſs to their own deſtruction. Oh, that God would open the eyes of thoſe that have not yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, that they may ſee what they are, and where they are, and what danger they are expoſed to! So much of the firſt Uſe of Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:45614:40"/>The ſecond Uſe is by way of Examination; How nearly does it concern every one of us, to call our ſelves to an account, whether we be in the number of Chriſts Sheep, or no? otherwiſe, we can have no comfort by this Doctrine. But may be you will ſay to me, How ſhall we do certainly to know that we are the Sheep of Chriſt, and that Chriſt is that Shepherd that feeds us like a Flock? For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this; We cannot curiouſly pry into Gods decree, to tell you who are not his Sheep; for it may be there are many that belong to the Election of Grace, that is, many are the Sheep of Chriſt, that are not yet called, nor converted, that are wandring in the Wilderneſ; yet; and though the Lord will not ſuffer them to wander to Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet for the preſent they are not brought into the Folds; therefore we cannot ſay, who are not his Sheep, we cannot ſay who are Reprobate; we may know who are Elected, but we cannot know who are Reprobated; we can tell who are his Sheep, but we cannot tell who are not his Sheep: Now they that are his Sheep, that are Converted and brought home to the Folds of Chriſt, they may be known by theſe four ſigns:</p>
            <p>Firſt, If thou art a Sheep of Jeſus Chriſt, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Shepherd hath ſet his mark upon thee, whereby he does know thee, and will own thee at the great day of his appearing, <hi>John</hi> 10.14, <hi>I am the good Shepherd, and know my Sheep, and am known of mine:</hi> I know every one of my Sheep, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19, <hi>The Lord knoweth them that are his:</hi> he knows them with a diſtinguiſhing knowledg. There are, and will be, at the great and dreadful day of Jeſus Chriſt, abundance that will claim acquaintance with Jeſus Chriſt; Oh, what ſeeking will there be to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45614:41"/>find his favour at that great day! ſeeking, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and crying with tears of blood, for his favour at that day! many will claim acquaintance, and ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> Matt. 7.22, 23, <hi>Have not we propheſied in thy name? have not we heard thee teach in our Synagogues? have not we heard thy Meſſengers which thou haſt ſent in thy name, teaching on the Lords day, and on the week-day? nay, have not we ſate at thy Table with thee in the uſe of the Sacrament of thy Body and Blood?</hi> to whom the Lord Chriſt will ſay, <hi>I know you not,</hi> Why? becauſe he does not ſee his Mark upon them: nay, they themſelves, when their conſciences are once awakened, and they begin to look and ſearch for the Mark, they cannot find it upon themſelves, and therefore they will hear that dreadful ſentence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, What is this mark whereby Jeſus Chriſt knows his ſheep, and whereby they may know that they are his? I anſwer, This mark is the holy Spirit of God, which he beſtows upon every true believer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit;</hi> that is, he that is united to Chriſt, hath the ſame ſpirit that Chriſt hath, hath one and the ſame ſpirit that Chriſt hath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, <hi>Now if any man hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his:</hi> If any man have not this mark upon him, the ſpirit of Chriſt, our Saviour will never own that man for his. Hence it is the Spirit of God is compared to a Seal or Mark, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 1.13, <hi>After ye believed, ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe.</hi> If thou haſt received this mark, this ſeal of the Spirit of God upon thy ſoul, thou maiſt be as ſure that thou art one of Chriſts
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45614:41"/>ſheep, as if thou didſt ſee thy name written in the Book of Life. I, but here it may be demanded, But may not this Seal, or this mark be counterfeited? may not a man be miſtaken, and deceived, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath this mark, the Spirit of God, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he hath it not? To this I anſwer; Yes, it is poſſible for a man to be miſtaken; and therefore the Apoſtle ſo often preſſes this duty of Examination, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5, <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own ſelves: know ye not your own ſelves that Jeſus Chriſt is in you except you be reprobates?</hi> And let every man prove his own works: the work of grace in his heart, let him prove it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4, <hi>Then ſhall he have rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not in another:</hi> he ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the teſtimony of his own conſcience, and not in the witneſs of anothers tongue: therefore we ſhould be examining our hearts, what operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Spirit of God hath had upon our ſpirits, whether it hath been an enlightning, a quickning, a convincing, a heart-warming, a ſealing, and a healing ſpirit: certainly the healing and ſealing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the Spirit goes together, as I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed you. Many boaſt of the Spirit of God; they queſtion not but they have the Spirit of God; but I told you the Spirit of God never ſets his feal to a blank; there is firſt ſome work of the Spirit of God upon the ſoul, enlightning, convincing, quickning and drawing the heart to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So we ſhould examine the fruits and effects of the Spirit of God upon our ſouls. Now there are four fruits eſpecially whereby a man may know he hath <hi>received, not the ſpirit that is of the world, but the ſpirit that is of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12, by theſe four ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:45614:42"/>Firſt, An unſeigned love to the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, that is one effect of the Spirit of God, that proves Jeſus Chriſt hath ſet his mark upon him that hath it, <hi>John</hi> 13.35, <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love one to another.</hi> This is a mark I ſet upon my ſheep. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.7, 8, 12, <hi>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God: and every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God: He that loveth not, knoweth not God. for God is love;</hi> And in ver. 12, <hi>If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We may know the Spirit of God is beſtowed upon us, by conſtancy in our profeſſion, and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs in the ways of truth: this is one certain mark of the Spirit of God, when a man can hold faſt his profeſſion, and that without wavering; can keep cloſe to the truth. How did <hi>Job</hi> approve himſelf to be one that belonged to God? <hi>My foot hath held his ſteps</hi> (ſaith he), <hi>his way have I kept, and not declined,</hi> Job 23.11. And how did <hi>David</hi> prove himſelf to be one of his ſheep? <hi>I have choſen the way of truth, and I have ſtuck unto thy teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119.30, 31. That is a dreadful Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in <hi>John</hi> 2.9, <hi>Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God.</hi> He ſpeaks of tranſgreſſion in Judgment, in running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to corrupt Opinions; and he that abides not in the Doctrine of God, but falls from the Truths of Chriſt, he hath no part in God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By a zeal for Gods Glory, his Cauſe, his Truth, eſpecially in evil times. That man that can ſtand up for God, when others forſake him, and ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſthim: that man that can be moſt zealous in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Gods Truth, and can ſay with <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69.9, <hi>The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45614:42"/>up: and the reproaches of them that reproached thee, are fallen upon me.</hi> And <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.158, <hi>I beheld the tranſgreſſors, and was grieved, becauſe they kept not thy word.</hi> By this may we know the Spirit of God is in us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By ſympathy and compaſſion towards our Brethren that are in afflictions and miſery: if one member ſuffer, all the reſt of the members ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with it: when we can ſigh in their ſorrows, and bleed in their wounds, and be affected with their miſeries and calamities, as if they were our own. By theſe effects we may know whether we have received the mark of Chriſt, that is, the Spirit of Chriſt. That is the firſt ſign, if you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Mark of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If thou be a Sheep of Chriſt, thou art returned from thy former wandrings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25, <hi>Ye were as ſheep going aſtray, but are now returned to the Shepherd and Biſhop of our ſouls.</hi> Canſt thou ſay, there hath been a work of Converſion wrought on thy ſoul? Once thou waſt unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but now art profitable; once thou wert wandring in the wilderneſs of ſin, but now thou art brought home to Jeſus Chriſt: Is there a work of Converſion wrought in thy ſoul? canſt not thou ſay now, I am not the ſame man I was, the ſame woman I was? Certainly if there be a returning from your ways of wandring, and walking in paths of new obedience, and keeping in the Fold of Chriſt, then you are the Sheep of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If thou be a Sheep of Jeſus Chriſt, thou mayſt know it by thy carriage towards thy Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; if thou art a Sheep of Chriſt, thou wilt know thy Shepherd, thou wilt know and ſee ſo much ſweetneſs, fulneſs, and all-ſufficiency in him,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45614:43"/>that thou wilt ſay, None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt: thou wilt count all things but droſs and dung in compariſon of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Thou wilt hear his voice: <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me,</hi> John 10.27. Now to hear the voice of Chriſt, is to be able to diſcern his voice from the voice of ſtrangers. The Spouſe was able to diſcern the voice of her Beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.8, <hi>The voice of my Beloved.</hi> The great work he was to do, was to work out redemption for me; he was to do and ſuffer much, but all could not daunt him; <hi>But he comes leaping on the mountains, and skipping on the hills.</hi> Then they follow him: Chriſt ſheep have not only the Ear-mark to hear his voice, but alſo the foot-mark, they follow him whitherſoever he goes: when Chriſt calls them, they ſay, <hi>Lo, here we are.</hi> They follow him, by imitating him in his Patience, Meekneſs, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if thou wilt ſtudy how to be like him, that thou mayſt be made more and more conformable to his Image; by thy carriage towards thy Shepherd, thou mayſt know if thou art his Sheep, thou wilt know him, hear his voice, follow him, and labour to be made conformable to him,</p>
            <p>A fourth mark whereby thou mayſt know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art a Sheep of Jeſus Chriſt, is this, Thou mayſt know it by thy carriage towards the Flock; that is, towards thy fellow Servants, towards thoſe that are the members of Jeſus Chriſt: It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Sheep, that they are the moſt profitable creatures you can name; ſo, if thou be a ſheep of Jeſus Chriſt, thou wilt not be an unprofitable burthen in thy ſtation, but thou wilt be fruitful in thy place, and profitable to others: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.33,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45614:43"/>
               <hi>Even as I pleaſe all men in all things, not ſeeking my own profit, but the profit of many that they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> And ſheep, as they are profitable, ſo they are innocent, and harmleſs creatures, they wrong, they injure none; ſo if thou be one of the ſheep of Chriſt, thou wilt be harmleſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15, <hi>That ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the ſons of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Nation.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> word for Harmleſs is there, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>without Horns,</hi> not puſhing one another: if you be the ſheep of Chriſt, you will dearly love one another: but if you bite and devour one another, you are Dogs and not Sheep.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Sheep are contented with their Paſture; Oh! if thou be a ſheep of Jeſus Chriſt, thou wilt bleſs God in any ſtate and condition whatſoever thou art in: thou wilt ſay, If I have gotten Jeſus Chriſt, no matter how poor, and low, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable my condition on earth be.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Sheep uſually are united one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they go in Flocks and Herds, they do not willingly forſake one another: If thou be a ſheep of Chriſt, thou wilt <hi>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> Epheſ. 4.3. Thou wilt not forſake the aſſembly of Gods Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. Oh my Brethren, you ſhould labour to find theſe ſneep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon your ſouls.</p>
            <p>A third Uſe, it is for Exhortation: If Jeſus Chriſt be the bleſſed Shepherd, as you have heard him deſcribed, that hath the greateſt care, and love, and power, and reward; Oh! what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation might this be to every one to come to Jeſus Chriſt, and to ſtand out no longer! many perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have been tendered to you many hundred
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45614:44"/>times, and yet ſome of you never brought home to Jeſus Chriſt to this day: Oh, that this might be that bleſſed day wherein Jeſus Chriſt and ſome wandring ſheep may be brought together! Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider who calls thee, it is not a Judg, but a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; and conſider why he calls, not to hurt, but to heal thee? not to kill, but to cure thee; not to puniſh, but to pity thee; Oh, think therefore with thy ſelf, that thou heareſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to uſe a homely Phraſe) as it were, whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling after thee, as he doth in the miniſtry of his word; ſometimes he comes with ſecret whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: ſometimes he comes openly, whiſtling, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, calling, crying in the ears of ſinners: Oh, do but think that thou heardſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt calling, and crying after thee, Why wilt thou die, and periſh? Why wilt thou be loſt when thou mayſt have a Saviour? Oh, but ſays the poor ſoul, I fear, I fear, that I am ſo diſeaſed, and that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will not look upon me: Remember, that this Shepherd is compared to a Shepherd that hath healing under his wings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2,</p>
            <p>But ſays the ſoul, I am afraid I have ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed him, he will never own me: Remember, he is a meek, gentle, and compaſſionate Saviour. There are two things that make men afraid: and they are, Pride and Fury; theſe are not in Chriſt, <hi>I am meek and lowly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29, <hi>and fury is not in me.</hi> But I am loſt, ſays the poor ſheep; Jeſus Chriſt will ſeek that that is loſt; but if I do come, will he certainly own me, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me? I anſwer, Look upon that comfortable Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4, 5, 6, <hi>What man of you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a hundred ſheep, if he loſe one of them, doth not leave the Ninety and nine in the Wilderneſs, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45614:44"/>go after that which is loſt until he find it? and when he hath found it, he layeth it on his ſhoulders, rejoycing; and when he cometh home, he calleth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether his friends and neighbours, ſaying unto them, Rejoyce with me, for I have found my ſheep which was loſt.</hi> There are three or four things very obſervable in that Parable, which I would have every poor ſinner that is afraid to come to Chriſt, to look upon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Obſerve, the Shepherd he leaves ninety and nine in the Wilderneſs, and goes and ſeeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that one ſheep that is loſt. Obſerve, if there be but one ſheep loſt or miſſing, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt beſtows as much pains and care in ſeeking that one ſheep, as if that all the ſheep were loſt: there was but one ſheep miſſing, yet he hath ſo much care of that one, that he leaves all the ninety and nine to ſeek that. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſo much care of every one of his ſheep, as if he had but one ſheep to care for: as the Sun for example would ſhine upon the world, though there were but one man in it to ſhine upon: ſo this bleſſed Son of righteouſneſs, if but one ſheep be loſt, he ſeeks after that one.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Obſerve, the Shepherd there ſeeks the ſheep before ever the ſheep ſeek the Shepherd. The Lord Jeſus prevents us with his mercies; we cannot ſeek him till he firſt ſeeks us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. v. laſt, you have <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer, <hi>I have gone aſtray like a loſt ſheep: ſeek thy ſervant, for I do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thy commandements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, when he hath found this ſheep, he carries it upon his ſhoulders, or as the Text tells you, <hi>he carries his lambs in his arms, and gathers them in his boſom.</hi> Mark this, and let it ſink
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45614:45"/>into your hearts: never did any man upon earth go to heaven any other way but upon the ſhoulders of Jeſus Chriſt: never was ſheep ſaved, but only by being embraced in the arms of this bleſſed Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Obſerve, the Shepherd rejoyceth when he hath found the ſheep; he rejoyceth to find this one loſt ſheep; obſerve this for thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, thou that art a poor wandring ſheep, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from coming to Jeſus Chriſt: obſerve, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will be more glad in receiving and entertaining thee, than thou canſt be in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him. You ſee he rejoyceth that he hath found this one loſt ſheep. Oh therefore be exhorted in Gods fear, to ſtand out no longer, but you that have not yet cloſed with Jeſus Chriſt, come to this Shepherd, that whatſoever your diſeaſes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies may be, they may be all removed, and your ſouls ſaved. But may be you will ſay, how ſhall we do to come to this Shepherd, that ſo we may be ſaved by him? I anſwer briefly, That man that would come to Chriſt, he muſt reſolve:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he will flye out of himſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all ſelf-confidence, and ſelf-excellency, and ſelf-righteouſneſs: he that would come to Chriſt, he muſt come poor, come in the ſenſe of his own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, come like a poor diſtreſſed ſheep without a Shepherd; he muſt come in the ſenſe and feeling of his own wants and weakneſs: <hi>The Son of man came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt,</hi> Matth. 18.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Luke 19.10. Loſt! we are loſt by nature; therefore Chriſt came to ſave all? no, that is not the meaning; but he came to ſave thoſe that feel themſelves loſt: thou muſt be ſenſible of thine own ſpiritual want; thou muſt be ſpiritually poor, or poor in ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:45614:45"/>Secondly, Learn to ſee ſo much beauty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in him, that thou canſt be content to part with any thing for him, any thing that ſtands in competition with him, or oppoſition againſt him; let all go, and ſay, I would have Jeſus Chriſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I part with for his ſake.</p>
            <p>Again, Be ſure you hearken to the voice of Chriſt, if thou wouldſt have him for thy Shepherd, <hi>John</hi> 10.4, 5, <hi>And when he putteth forth his own ſheep, he goeth before them, and his own ſheep fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, for they know his voice, and a ſtranger they will not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of ſtrangers.</hi> If thou art a ſheep of Jeſus Chriſt, thou wilt learn the voice of Chriſt, and not be ſeduced and led away with the error of the wicked, to fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs. When <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour deſired to have ſome conference with <hi>Arius</hi> the Heretick, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs perſwaded him not to talk and confer with ſuch a Heretick that was ſo envious; for, ſays ſhe, by hearing of him, you may be perverted by his words, and ſo inſnared in his curſed opinion. This was excellent counſel!</p>
            <p>Laſtly, You muſt come to Chriſt in a way of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; you muſt take up a reſolution to obey this bleſſed Shepherd. The ſame Hebrew word, that ſignifies to feed, ſignifies to rule; if Chriſt feed thee in his Paſtures, he muſt rule thee. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite my heart to thee, that I may fear thy name,</hi> Pſal. 86.11. But what would you have me do? Come with a full purpoſe, and cleave to this Shepherd, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to leave him. Do as the Diſciples of Chriſt, in <hi>John</hi> 6.67, 68, <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto the Twelve, Will ye alſo go away? Then Simon Peter anſwered him, Lord, to whom ſhall we go, thou haſt the words
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45614:46"/>of eternal life.</hi> Oh that we had ſuch a reſolution as <hi>Peter</hi> had, not only to ſay ſo, but to do ſo, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.33, <hi>Though all men ſhall be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I never be offended:</hi> Maſter, though all forſake thee, yet will we believe in thy name. Thus if you follow this Shepherd, hear, and obey him, then all the ſweetneſs and marrow of this Doctrine belongs to you: The Lord write theſe things upon our hearts, and draw us nearer and nearer to him, that we may ſay he feeds us, and cloaths us, and gives us eternal life. So much for the firſt point of Doctrine drawn from the firſt part of that, Chriſts Relation to his People.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Doct. <hi>JEſus Chriſt in his carriage to his People hath a tender reſpect to their infirmities.</hi> For the proof of this Point, I ſhall give you but one place of Scripture, and it is ſo full, that I ſhall need no more, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.19. It is ſpoken of our bleſſed Saviour; ſays our Saviour, <hi>I will ſeek that which was loſt, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will ſtrengthen that which was ſick,</hi> There are four ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons mentioned there, that have a great deal of need of Chriſts care and compaſſion, and of his tender indulgence towards them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Some there are that are <hi>loſt Sheep,</hi> not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45614:47"/>or totally loſt, but loſt in their own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, in their own ſenſe and feeling, as <hi>David</hi> complains in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.176, <hi>I have gone aſtray like a loſt ſheep.</hi> Now theſe, our Bleſſed Saviour will ſeek, he will recover them by his Word and Spirit, though in their own apprehenſions they think themſelves loſt, dead, damned, and undone: yet notwithſtanding he will ſeek them, and bring them into his Fold again.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Others there are that are <hi>driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and that is a further degree of Miſery; Satan hath not only gotten them out of the Fold, but when they are got out, they wander more and more, they are driven more and more from Jeſus Chriſt, by Satans ſubtilty, and his temptations. Now ſays our Saviour, thoſe which are driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, I will bring them again.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Some are in a further degree of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, they are broken, broken with diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: they are ready to ſay, There is no hope, no mercy belongs to ſuch ſinners as they are, and theſe are in a worſe condition than the former; for a ſheep may be loſt, and driven from the Fold, but if that be all, he may return; but if the ſheep have broken a Leg, though he hear the voice of the Shepherd, he cannot help himſelf, his Leg is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and he cannot come at the call of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd: So ſome are ſo broken with diſcouragements, that though they hear the voice of Chriſt, they are ready to ſay, No mercy belongs to us. Now ſays Chriſt, theſe will I bind up again, and reſtore that Comfort that will quiet their hearts, and ſpeak peace to them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Others are ſick, and that is yet a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of miſery; when a poor ſheep doth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45614:47"/>not only wander, and is driven away, and hath a broken leg, diſcouraged with temptations, but hath ſome kind of ſickneſs of ſpirit ſeized on him, ſo that he ſaith, his ſoul abhors all manner of meat, as <hi>David</hi> deſcribes a man in ſuch a condition: ſays he, <hi>his ſoul abhors all manner of meat, and they are brought to the very gates of death,</hi> Pſalm 107, 18. This is the ſaddeſt condition of all; but ſays Chriſt, theſe are ſuch that I will ſtrengthen. If you would know the reaſon why Chriſt hath ſuch a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Peoples infirmities, I will give you theſe Three:</p>
            <p>The Firſt is drawn from that gracious Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is in him: He is a Saviour of a very meek, mild, tender, and compaſſionate heart; this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by thoſe Names and Titles that ſets forth the ſweetneſs of our Saviours diſpoſition in Scripture; he compares himſelf to a Father, to a Phyſician, to a Husband.</p>
            <p>To a Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13, it is the ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>Behold, I, and the Children which God hath given me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, he compares him to a Phyſician, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.12, <hi>But when Jeſus heard that, he ſaid unto them, They that be whole, need not a Phyſician, but they that be ſick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So likewiſe to a Husband, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5, <hi>For thy Maker is thy Husband, the Lord of Hoſts is his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, of whom ſhould Children expect pity and compaſſion, but of their Father? <hi>as a Father pitieth his own Children, ſo is the Lord merciful to them that fear him,</hi> Pſalm 103.13. And of whom ſhould a Patient expect help, but of the Phyſician? And of whom ſhould a Wife expect pity, but of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45614:48"/>band? who knows how to give the Wife the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a mild Uſage, becauſe he knows ſhe is the weaker Veſſel. All theſe Relations of a Father, a Phyſician, a Husband, and of a Shepherd, they are moſt eminently in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. That is one reaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He hath a tender reſpect to our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, becauſe he is a Merciful High-Prieſt, toucht with the ſenſe of our infirmities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, <hi>For we have not a high Prieſt which cannot be toucht with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> Heb. 2.18, <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> As God ſpeaks to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Exod. 23.9, <hi>Alſo thou ſhalt not oppreſs a ſtranger, for ye know the heart of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſeeing ye were ſtrangers in the Land of Egypt.</hi> So the Lord Chriſt, he knows the hearts of poor, tempted, broken, bruiſed ſouls, becauſe he himſelf was tempted. A Father, you know, becauſe he is acquainted with the diſtempers of his Child more than a ſtranger is, pities his Child more than a ſtranger doth: So the Lord Chriſt he knows our frame, he conſiders our temper, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.13, 24, therefore he pities us more than ſtrangers do, that do not know our tempers; <hi>he conſiders we are but duſt, and as the wind that paſſeth away, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſuffers not his whole diſpleaſure to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us,</hi> Pſal. 78.38, 39. That's the ſecond reaſon: he pities us, and hath a tender reſpect to our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, becauſe he is a merciful High Prieſt, toucht with the ſenſe of our infirmities.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath a tender reſpect to the infirmities of his people, becauſe he loves and likes, and means to cheriſh the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45614:48"/>of grace in any one of his poor children: he loves grace, and he likes it, and cheriſheth it: he looks more at the good in us, which he means to cheriſh, than at the bad in us, which he means to aboliſh: the Lord Chriſt looks at the very bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and bloſſoms of grace in the ſoul; thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of grace are precious unto him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſays of a little grace, as a man ſays of a tree that has but one cluſter upon it, Do not cut the tree, it hath a bleſſing in it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.8. The Lord Chriſt will not deſtroy a cluſter of grapes, if there be but one cluſter. If there be but one Cherry on a tree, it ſhews there is ſome life in the tree; one Cherry upon a tree, it ſhews there is life as well as if there was twenty Pounds upon it; one Cherry ſhews that it is a living tree, and a man will not cut down that tree. The Lord Chriſt will cheriſh the leaſt beginnings of grace; if there be but a ſpark of grace in the ſoul, he will not quench it, but blow it up into a flame. Look as Phyſicians deal with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed Patients, they do not adminiſter purging Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the greatneſs of their diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, but according to the ſtrength of their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt deals with his own children, not according to the diſeaſes and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that are in them, not according to the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of their ſins, but according to the meaſure of their ſtrength; he will not lay on them more than he will give them ſtrength to bear. Theſe are the reaſons of the point.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the Application of the point, Becauſe this is Childrens bread, and Dogs are ready to ſnatch at it, that yet have no right to it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the explication of the point, there are theſe three <hi>Quaeries</hi> that would be ſatisfied: Firſt,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45614:49"/>What an Infirmity is. Secondly, What are the cauſes of thoſe Infirmities. Thirdly, What are the ſigns and ſymptoms of thoſe Infirmities.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What an Infirmity is. An infirmity (brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) in the ſoul, is this; <hi>Some ſickneſs or indiſpoſition of the ſoul, that ariſes from the weakneſs of grace.</hi> Or an Infirmity is this, When the purpoſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the heart is upright, but a man wants ſtrength to perform that purpoſe; when the ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41. when a man can ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not,</hi> Rom. 7.18. When the bent and inclination of the ſoul is right; but either through ſome violence of corruption, or ſtrength of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, a man is diverted and turned out of the way. As the needle in the Seamans Compaſs, you know if it be right, it will ſtand always North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the bent of it will be towards the North-Pole; being jogged and troubled, it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be put out of frame and order, yet the bent and inclination of it is ſtill Northward. This is an infirmity. That's the firſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What are the cauſes of theſe Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? there are divers cauſes you muſt know of our infirmities: as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, An infirmity may ariſe from want of age, for want of time to gather ſtrength. The Lord Chriſt you muſt know hath Lambs in his Fold as well as Sheep, and he hath plants in his Orchard as well as ſtronger Trees, and Babes as well as ſtrong Men. Now ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>I write to you Babes and little Children, becauſe your ſins are pardoned for his name-ſake,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.12. Obſerve there, that remiſſion of ſin is beſtowed not only upon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45614:49"/>young men, that are ſtrong to reſiſt temptations, not only upon aged men, that are well experienced in the ways of grace, but it is beſtowed even upon Babes: <hi>I write unto you little Children, becauſe your ſins are pardoned for his name-ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Our infirmities may ariſe alſo from a want of the means of grace, either when men want milk, or the ſincere milk of the word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, or have but little of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Infirmities may ariſe from ſome ſecret corruption that was undiſcovered in our firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: This may be an occaſion of an infirmity; for that may both weaken the ſoul, and exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtemper and diſquiet it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Our infirmities may ariſe from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking ſound and ſolid truths, and diſquieting our thoughts with <hi>doubtful diſputations,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1, when men trouble their heads with trifles, or with matters of leſs moment, and in the mean while neglect the marrow of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; even as little Children, that forſake whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food, and feed on green apples, and ſo put their bodies into diſtempers.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Our infirmities may ariſe from this, when our affections are too much carried out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the World, and the things of the World; for certain it is, look how much the ſoul is carried out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the world, ſo much the weaker it is: the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger our love to the world is, the weaker is our love to Jeſus Chriſt, and to grace, and ſpiritual things.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Our infirmities may ariſe from the not right ordering of our company; dead company, dead and barren company many times make dead and barren hearts.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Our infirmities may ariſe from our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45614:50"/>loſing our firſt love, remitting of the zeal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and forwardneſs, that once we had in the ways of grace: when we grow looſe and ſlothful in the ſervice of our God, and do not ſtir up the grace of God that is in us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. Exerciſe you know encreaſeth ſtrength; but want of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe many times occaſions weakneſs: When a man prays coldly, hears the word of God coldly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates at the Lords Table coldly: The more coldneſs there is in the performance of the Duties of Religion, the more weakneſs there will be in the ſoul. Theſe are the cauſes of our infirmities.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It may be demanded, What are the ſigns and ſymptoms of an Infirmity? (briefly) I ſhall give you theſe four.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Where there are infirmities, there is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, though there be want of ſpiritual ſtrength: this is a certain ſign of an infirmity. You know there is a great deal of difference between a dead man and a weak man; a dead man that hath not life, and a weak man that hath life, and wants ſtrength. It cannot be ſaid of any wicked man that he is a weak man, but he is a dead man: neither can it be ſaid that he does any thing weakly, but he does it wickedly. Obſerve what our Saviour ſpeaks of a <hi>bruiſed reed,</hi> he ſpeaks of it as a thing that yet hath ſome life in it: for a reed, though it be exceeding weak, that it is ſhaken with every wind, yet by the ſide of the water it grows, it hath life in it. Make this ſure to thy ſelf, that thou haſt life in thee, or elſe the comfort of this Doctrine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belong to thee; if ſo be thou haſt life in thee, though thy Grace be weak, yet if thou haſt life, it is but an infirmity. But you will ſay, How may I know I have life in me? I anſwer, You may know it thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:45614:50"/>Firſt, Thou mayſt know it by thy ſpiritual feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; thou wilt feel what hurts thee; thou wilt feel ſin to be a great burthen, and thou wilt groan under it, and thou wilt bemoan thy ſelf like <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, Jer.</hi> 31.18, <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf thus; Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoak; turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God: ſurely after that I was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I repented: and after that I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh; I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Thou mayſt know it by that ſpiritual ſtrife, and combat, and conflict that is in thee: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there will be a conflict in thy ſoul, becauſe there are two contrary principles there; put water to water, or fire to fire, and there is no conflict; but put water and fire together, and there will be a great conflict: So corruption will not ſtrive with corruption; but where there is Grace and corruption in one ſoul, there will be a combat and conflict, the <hi>Fleſh will luſt againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.17.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Thou mayſt know thou haſt life in thee by thy ſpiritual crying; thou wilt cry out for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from danger and evil: <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> Thou wilt make this the chief ſubject of thy ſuit and ſupplication to God, from day to day: O, that once I might be freed from a baſe whoriſh, backſliding-heart, that continually is departing from God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If thou haſt life, certainly that grace thou haſt, though it be but weak, though it be but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45614:51"/>little, though it be but as a ſpark, yet it ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt corruption; for wherever the Lord Chriſt enters into the ſoul to dwell, there he comes like a Conquerour, and he brings forth Judgment unto victory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20. That is, his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be victorious over all the oppoſition of ſin and Satan: Grace, like oyl, will be uppermoſt: if there be but a ſpark of Grace in thy heart, it ſhall not be quenched, but it ſhall rather increaſe more and more, and at laſt ſhall grow up into a flame, as the fire of the Lord that came upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijahs</hi> offering, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.38, <hi>conſumed the burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacrifice, and the wood, and the ſtones, and the duſt, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</hi> Grace is a fire that comes down from Heaven; though there be but a little ſpark of it at firſt, yet by little and little it will lick up all the water of our corruptions, and conſume our ſins; Grace will grow ſtronger and ſtronger, and corruption wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and weaker. That is the firſt ſymptom of an infirmity. If there be ſpiritual life in the ſoul; but if there be not ſpiritual life, there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond Sign or Symptom of an infirmity, is this, That may be ſaid to be an infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, when ſome particular action croſſes the main intention of the heart; If thine eye be ſingle, if thy heart be upright, if the Byas and bent of thy ſoul be towards God, then all the obliquity, or all the ſwervings in thy life, are but lookt upon as infirmities: For example, A good Archer that is handling his Bow, may-be his eye is right, and his aim is right, but through the weakneſs of his hand, or the diſtemper of his Bow, he may miſs the Mark, that is an infirmity; So here, if thy eye be right
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45614:51"/>towards Gods Commandments: if thy intention be to pleaſe God, if the bent and byas of thy ſoul be God-ward, not ſin-ward, then all the reſt of the obliquity, or ſwervings that are in thy actions, are lookt upon but as infirmities: As a Traveller, for example, in his journey; if he ſet his face the right way, and he be enquiring the way, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow the way; or if, when he goeth out of the way, he check himſelf, though he may miſs of the way through ignorance, or may be ſeduced by ſome that told him wrong; yet that may be ſaid to be but an infirmity: So here, when thou canſt ſet thy face towards Heaven, as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> are deſcribed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.5, <hi>They ſhall ask the way to Zion with their faces thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; ſaying, Come let us joyn our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</hi> When a man thus ſets his face towards Heaven, then his wandrings out of the way (if they be beſide the intention of his purpoſe and mind) are lookt upon but as infirmities; <hi>David</hi> was out of his way, when in a fury he would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on <hi>Nabal</hi> for his churliſhneſs; when he ſaid, <hi>God do ſo to me, and more alſo, if I cut not off Nabal, and every one that belongs to his Family;</hi> yet when <hi>Abigail,</hi> a wiſe Woman, comes and tells him, he was out of his way, how glad was he? and ſtops his courſe, and ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael which ſent thee this day to meet me; and bleſſed be thy advice, and bleſſed be thou which haſt kept me this day from coming to ſhed blood, and from avenging my ſelf with my own hand,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.32, 33. See the difference between the ſin of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the ſin of <hi>Peter; Judas</hi> you know, he ſinned with deliberation, and his intention was
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45614:52"/>ſtark naught; his intention and purpoſe of betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Maſter, was to inrich himſelf; he was a Thief, and nibled money out of his Maſters Bag, therefore his intention was naught. But on the contrary, look on <hi>Peter,</hi> when he thrice denyed his Maſter, it was a great ſin too, but it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his intention or purpoſe; certainly <hi>Peter</hi> had no intention at all to deny his Maſter; but it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with him, as a man that is writing with his Pen in his hand, and writing a ſtraight Line, but it may be ſome body comes and joggs him on the Elbow, ſo he makes a crooked line againſt his will: Or as a man that is ſhooting at a Mark, but ſome body comes and joggs his Elbow, and makes his Arrow to go awry; thus was it with <hi>Peter:</hi> This is the ſecond Sign or Symptome of an infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That is an Infirmity, when a mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is kept ſound and upright, that he does not approve of any ſin, when no ſin hath any allowance or approbation in his heart; this was the fruit of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> his Preaching, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.4, <hi>Every Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſhall be exalted, and every Mountain and Hill ſhall be made low, and the crooked ſhall be made ſtraight, and the rough places plain:</hi> that is, thoſe that are converted by <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> preaching, they would not look on crooked things as plain, or plain things as crooked; that is, they would not defend, or juſtifie themſelves in ſin, but look upon ſin as ſin, and duty as duty; and they would not look upon the ways of God as crooked, but ſtraight: they were indeed crooked to them before, becauſe their judgment was not ſound; but now they look upon them as ſtraight, and all his ways to be equal ways. A child of God will be ſure to commend
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45614:52"/>that duty which yet he cannot practiſe; and he will be ſure to condemn that ſin into which yet he often ſlips and falls, and that becauſe his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is right; duty will be duty in his eye, and ſin will be ſin in his eye, though through infirmity he may fail in the one, and fall into the other.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He that ſins through infirmity, will ſtill keep his conjugal love to Jeſus Chriſt; and although ſome failings in him may work a kind of eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between Chriſt and his ſoul; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his heart will ſtill cleave to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and this appears thus: Becauſe he will chuſe no other Husband, he will chuſe no other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for all this; but he would rejoyce with all his heart, if he might be but reconciled to Jeſus Chriſt; though there hath been ſome unkindneſs between Chriſt and him, <hi>He ſays, I will return to my firſt Husband, for then was it better with me than now,</hi> Hoſ. 2.7. and he is grieved for the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venneſs of his carriage towards ſo ſweet a Husband us he hath been to him. If there be ſuch a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in you, to hold faſt your conjugal love to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſtill keep cloſe to him, though there may be ſome unkindneſs, yet thou pitcheſt on no other Husband; certainly, this is but an infirmity. But ſays the poor ſoul, Can that be an infirmity, that cleaves to me all my days? that I have been vext and perplext with, twenty, thirty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Poſſibly there may be ſuch infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cleave to Gods children: As for example, ſome deadneſs in duties, dulneſs and deadneſs in hearing the Word; it may be ſlipperineſs of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or forgetfulneſs of the words we have heard; or it may be ſome ſtrong corruption, which is like
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45614:53"/>a thorn in the fleſh, which the Lord Jeſus hath left in thee, to humble thee, and to make thee baſe in thy own eyes, all thy days: But it may be then you will object, and ſay, How then will this ſtand with the Doctrine you delivered even now? you made it a mark or token of ſpiritual life, That Grace will prevail againſt corruption; that the Government of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt would be victorious?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, True Grace will be victorious at laſt, but I do not ſay, it will be all at once, but it will be by degrees; and it is ſome kind of victory and conqueſt over corruption, when it is ſubdued, though it be not quite extinguiſhed; if it be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and abated, though it be not deſtroyed; when a man can feelingly cry out of it, as the Apoſtle did, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi> and he breaks out, and ſays, <hi>thanks be to God, through Jeſus Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 7.25.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer: God ſometimes works by contraries; God is carrying on the work of Grace in his Children, when corruptions ſeem to be thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and growing; when God means to give his Children victory, he ſuffers them to be foyled firſt; the work of Grace in the heart ſometimes goes backwards, that it may go forwards: As the Seed that is ſown in the Field, it rots in the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſprings and grows: Sometimes you muſt know, that God will ſtrengthen us by our very ſlippings; he will have us learn to ſtand by our very falls and bruiſes; he will have us to be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by our weakneſſes and infirmities; he will have us to be deep-rooted by our ſhakings: Our infirmities are the keepers of our Graces; it makes us look more carefully to our own ſtandings; it is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45614:53"/>good therefore to obſerve the methods and manner of Gods dealing with our ſouls, and to learn to live by faith; be acting of faith in the buſineſs of our infirmities; for as I have often told you, The life of faith is in the uſe of faith; ſo much as we uſe faith, ſo much we live by it; it is good for a man to live by faith in point of his infirmities; and to ſay, when I am foyled, I ſhall have victory, when I fall, I ſhall ariſe; when I am weak, I am ſtrong, as the Church ſaid, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.8, <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine enemy; when I fall, I ſhall ariſe: when I ſit in darkneſs, the Lord ſhall be a light unto me.</hi> Thus you have the explication of the point, what an Infirmity is, and what are the cauſes of it, and what are the ſigns and ſymptoms of it. For the uſe of the point: 1. For <hi>Conſolation.</hi> 2. For <hi>Caution.</hi> 3. For <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, For <hi>Conſolation,</hi> becauſe that is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal uſe of the Text: And O, that I could ſpeak not only to the ears, but to the heart of any poor doubting, drooping, dejected ſoul: O that this Doctrine might be as a box of ointment, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſuch an one, to refreſh him; O that I eould but drop in ſome Conſolation into any poor brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoul that hears me this day, that ſuch an one might lift up thoſe hands that hang down, and feeble knees that tremble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.3.</p>
            <p>And this is the comfort I have to tender to thee, That the Lord will not reject thee for an infirmity: He carries his Lambs in his Arms, and gathers them in his boſom; poor weak ones, he carries them in his boſom, when it may be the Leg is broken, and they are not able to go; he gently leads thoſe with young, in all their fears, doubts, and diſquietments about their Condition; he hath a tender care of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45614:54"/>his Lambs, of his weak ones: If thou art but one of Chriſt, Lambs, know thus much for thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that he hath a care of the pooreſt Lamb that is in his Flock; if thou art a Plant in his Vineyard, know, that he hath a care of the tendereſt Plant; never was it known, that a merciful and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Father, caſt off a child becauſe of his weakneſs: many times, it may be, when the child is ſo ſick and weak, that it is not able to ſpeak, but only to ſay, Father; it may be it cannot ſpeak out; then the Bowels of the Father yearns towards him the more; the weaker the child is, and unable to ſpeak, the more his compaſſions are rowling towards him; O let not our unbelief make Jeſus Chriſt unnatural; Do we think that Jeſus Chriſt has leſs compaſſion toward his Lambs than <hi>Jacob</hi> had? <hi>Jacob</hi> was ſuch a Shepherd that he had ſuch a tender care of his Lambs, that, ſays he, if you over-drive the flocks, the lambs will die: and do you think that Jeſus Chriſt is leſs ſollicitous for the good of his? But alas! ſays the poor ſoul, my infirmities diſcourage me, they weaken my aſſurance, and rob me of my peace and comfort. I anſwer: true it is, infirmities do ſo, but they ſhould not do ſo; and that they may not do ſo, take theſe three or four Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider, in every infirmity, as there is ſomething againſt God, ſo there is ſomething alſo from God: There is ſomething againſt God, that is true, becauſe our infirmities are not ſuitable to the holineſs and ſtrictneſs of his Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould ſtrive againſt them with prayer, and care and watchfulneſs. But as there is ſomething againſt God, ſo there is ſomething alſo from God: It may be he lets looſe thoſe infirmities upon thee, even like a Meſſenger of <hi>Satan,</hi> to buffet thee, to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45614:54"/>humble thee, to prove thee, and to teach thee to priſe Jeſus Chriſt ſo much the more. It may be God lets looſe theſe infirmities, as the avenger of blood was let looſe upon the man ſlayer, to force the man ſlayer to fly to the City of Refuge, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35; ſo theſe infirmities are let looſe to force thee to fly to Jeſus Chriſt the Refuge of thy ſoul. Some there are, that was it not for ſtrong infirmities cleaving to them, ſtrong temptations meeting with them, would never be beholding to Jeſus Chriſt at all: Look therefore in every infirmity, not only at the evil of it, but at the good God intends by it; it may be God intends good to thy ſoul by them: Whereas we, as he ſaid once, many times make plaiſters to become a poyſon, the Lord is able on the contrary to make a plaiſter of poyſon: We many times bring ſin out of Grace: God can bring grace out of ſin: he can bring Heaven out of Hell: therefore as there is ſomething againſt God, ſo there is ſomething from God in our infirmities: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould not be diſcouraged becauſe of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider the great difference between thy ſelf when thou waſt in a ſtate of nature, and now when thou art a weak Chriſtian, and ſubject to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; did not God reject thee at that time, and caſt thee off, when thou waſt an open Traitor and Rebel, marching on in a courſe of rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? did he not caſt thee off, but had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on thee, and did pity thee, and ſpare thee? then certainly he will not now caſt thee off for ſome unvoluntary errour, which thou bewaileſt, and mourneſt for in his preſence: Did the Lord ſeek thee at that time when thou deſpiſedſt him? certainly then, he will not deſpiſe thee when thou feekeſt him. That is a good argument of the Apoſtle,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45614:55"/>to ſtrengthen, and ſupport, and comfort drooping ſpirits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10, <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life:</hi> Certainly therefore God will not reject thee for an infirmity, if he was ſo gracious to thee in thy ſtate of ſin and enmity to him: there is as great a difference between a ſtate of grace and a ſtate of nature, as there is between Heaven and Hell, though grace be never ſo weak, and imperfect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider the great danger of being pluckt away from Jeſus Chriſt, by giving too much way to deſpondency: Satans main drift, and great plot is, to drive thee away from Jeſus Chriſt by thy infirmities; he labours to bring thee to deſpond and deſpair, and to ſay there is no hope for thee; becauſe Satan knows, the more he draws thee from Jeſus Chriſt, the weaker thou wilt be: Thy infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ſhould not drive thee from Chriſt, but they ſhould drive thee to Chriſt, to improve and make uſe of his gracious diſpoſition, in helping and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thee in thy miſeries and diſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider what may be the cauſes of thy infirmities; thoſe infirmities will be cured in the cauſes. For example, if thy infirmities ariſe from want of age, or time to gather ſtrength, that will be cured; becauſe <hi>the path of the juſt is as a ſhining light, that ſhineth more and more to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect day,</hi> Prov. 4.18. Or if from want of the means of grace, or becauſe the means of grace thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeſt are not ſuch as others enjoy; the Lord in ſuch caſes will have a tender reſpect to thee, and meaſure to thee, not according to what thou haſt, but according to what thou wouldſt have. Again, if thy infirmities ariſe from ſome corruption, that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45614:55"/>was not diſcovered to thee at thy firſt converſion, thou muſt then pray, and beg, that the Lord would diſcover thy ſelf to thy ſelf more and more. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if thou haſt forſaken ſome old truths of God, and art grown weary of them, and hankereſt after Novelties, and new Opinions; then return from thy wandrings, and prize ſolid meat above kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws; beg that thy ſoul may taſte once again the ſweetneſs of Goſpel-truths. In a word, what ever the cauſe of your infirmities be, get the diſeaſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the cauſe, get thy heart more weaned from the World, and ſtir up thy ſelf to take hold of God; remember thy former zeal, and repent and do thy firſt works; and this is the way to get thy infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties healed. That's the firſt Uſe, a Uſe of Comfort and Conſolation.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Uſe, is a Uſe of Caution; The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as you have heard, hath a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his people, a tender care of his people, in reſpect of their infirmities: let not a wicked man then apply this to himſelf, and ſay, the Lord Chriſt will have a tender reſpect to me that go on in the courſe of ſin, that live in ſin, and lye in ſin, and ſleep in ſin, and wallow in ſin: No, for there is a great deal of difference between the weakneſs of a Lamb, and the wickedneſs of a Wolf; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt pities his Lambs for their weakneſs, but he doth not pity a Wolf for his wickedneſs; that is, that man who is reſolved to go on in a courſe of ſin, ſay a Miniſter what he can to the contrary, if he is dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, if he hath no ſpiritual life in him, if there be no work of grace begun in him, all that I have ſaid concerning Chriſts tender care of his peoples infirmities, doth not belong to him, he hath no part in this Inheritance; if thou
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45614:56"/>beeſt a Wolf, and not a Lamb, the Lord Chriſt that hath a tender care of his Lambs, will be ſure to meet thee, not as a Shepherd that carries his Lambs in his Arms, but he will meet thee as a Lion, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.7, 8, <hi>Therefore I will be unto them as a Lyon, as a Leopard by the way will I obſerve them: I will meet them as a Bear that is bereaved of her Whelps, and I will rent the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a Lyon, the wild beaſts ſhall tear them.</hi> The ſame Chriſt that is a Shepherd to his People, he knows how to be a Lyon, a Leopard, and a Bear to his Enemies. That is an awakening Scripture, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 68.21, <hi>But God ſhall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch an one as goeth on ſtill in his treſpaſſes.</hi> If therefore thou art one that goeſt on in thy treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, in an unreformed courſe; if thou liveſt in ſin, and ſetteſt thy heart on wickedneſs, and takeſt pleaſure therein, this doctrine doth not belong to thee, thou art not a Lamb in Chriſts account, he will not deal tenderly with thee; nay, he will deal moſt roughly with thee, his wrath and fury will be powred out upon thee, as the Prophet ſpeaks. That's the ſecond Uſe, of Caution.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, A word of <hi>Exhortation:</hi> If the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath ſuch a tender reſpect in his carriage to the infirmities of his People; O then reſolve to have no other Maſter but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; be under the conduct of no other Shepherd, but only this; O hear him, fear him, and follow him; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him whitherſoever he goes; follow him, how? by depending on him for direction, by cleaving to him in heart, and life; follow him by imitation; follow him by hearkning to his voice; follow him by being ruled by him, as before you are directed;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45614:56"/>ſeeing he is the Lord over his own Houſe, let him Rule in his Houſe, let thy ſoul be his Temple, wherein he may delight to dwell; ſay, Lord, Rule in me as thou pleaſeſt, ſo I may but be thine. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are they that are under the Government of Jeſus Chriſt; happy are they that ſubmit themſelves to his Guidance and Direction, to his Law, and his Spirit; certainly, ſuch ſhall find him a merciful, a meek, a compaſſionate, a tender-hearted Saviour, who <hi>gathers his Lambs in his Arms, and carries them in his Boſom, and gently leads thoſe that are with young.</hi>

            <p>THE holy Apoſtle having inſtructed theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> in the Doctrine of Chriſt in the foregoing Chapter, arms them againſt Seducers, and falſe Teachers, that would have corrupted that Doctrine, in this ſecond Chapter: It is not enough for Miniſters to give wholſome food unto their people, but they muſt alſo give them Antidotes againſt the poyſon of corrupt Doctrines: It is not enough for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to feed their people, but they muſt alſo fence their people againſt Wolves that would devour the flock. Thus does the holy Apoſtle here, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warns theſe <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and ſo fore-arms them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Seducers that would beguile them with Philoſophy, with legal Ceremonies, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Angels, and other ſuch corrupt Doctrines mentioned here in this ſecond Chapter. To that end he lays down this weighty rule for them to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45614:57"/>obſerve, <hi>As ye have therefore received the Lord Chriſt, ſo walk ye in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Text you may take notice of two things: Firſt, You have here a holy Rule preſcribed in theſe words, <hi>As you have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord:</hi> Secondly, a Practice anſwering that Rule here enjoyned; <hi>ſo alſo walk ye in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As ye have.</hi> The words will admit of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold interpretation: Either take the ſenſe thus; As you have received the Doctrine of Chriſt by <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras,</hi> who was a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1, 7; ſo do you perſevere in that Doctrine, and live according to it: this is the uſual interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given of the words. Or elſe they may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this ſenſe; As you have received the Lord Chriſt, that is, as you have received him into your hearts by faith, who is the way to eternal life; ſo walk ye in him: And as you have received grace from Chriſt, ſo accordingly act that grace that you have received: this is the interpretation that ſome give; I ſhall ſtick rather to this latter interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the handling of this Text. Many Doctrines may be gathered from this verſe; but becauſe my purpoſe is to diſpatch it in one Sermon, as looking upon it as a ſeaſonable Text, a ſuitable Subject for a day wherein we have been partakers of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ordinance of the Lords Supper, I will name but two or three Doctrines, and pitch upon the principal.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>As you have received Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve: <hi>Where the Goſpel is rightly received, Jeſus Chriſt is alſo received with it.</hi> Mark, the Apoſtle does not ſay, As you have received the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, but Chriſt himſelf; he that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receives the Doctrine of Chriſt, receives Chriſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45614:58"/>himſelf. Oh then, in how high reverence and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem ſhould we have the Goſpel! and what a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious ſin are they guilty of, that tread the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goſpel under foot! what a dreadful account have they to give! 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, <hi>When the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>As you have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mark: <hi>It is not enough to receive Jeſus Chriſt as a Saviour, but he muſt be received as a Lord, as a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler alſo;</hi> according to the tenour of my laſt Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31, <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt will be a Saviour to none but thoſe to whom he is a Prince. Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> in his Commentary upon the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> ſays, the falſe Apoſtles preacht Chriſt, and their Diſciples likewiſe received Chriſt; but neither did the falſe Apoſtles preach him, nor their Diſciples receive him as Lord; but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him as a fellow-Servant with <hi>Moſes:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays the Apoſtle, if you receive Chriſt rightly, you muſt receive him as a Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here I might obſerve, <hi>(Walk ye in him) That Chriſt is the way, the living way, the only way wherein we ſhould walk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt Doctrine is that which will compriſe the marrow of the Text, and it is this; <hi>That it is not enough for a Chriſtian to receive Chriſt, but he muſt alſo walk in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That you may underſtand the Doctrine aright, let me open the terms to you. There is a two-fold
<pb facs="tcp:45614:58"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:45614:59"/>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:45614:59"/>receiving of Chriſt, an habitual and a gradual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is an habitual receiving of Chriſt; of this ſpeaks the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 12, <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe in his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then ſecondly, There is a gradual receiving of him; and of this ſpeaks the Apoſtle in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19, <hi>And not holding the head, from which all the body by joynts and bands having nouriſhment miniſtred, and knit together, increaſeth with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of God.</hi> The whole body, that is the Church of God, and every Member; being knit to the head, that is, to Jeſus Chriſt; having nouriſhment ſupplied from the head, ſo the Members of Chriſt being ſupplied with nouriſhment from God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe with the increaſe of God. Obſerve, There is never a Member of Chriſt but is a growing Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: there is a gradual receiving of Chriſt, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him more and more, by degrees; as well as an habitual receiving of him. If you ask me, What is the difference between theſe two receivings of Chriſt, the habitual and gradual? I anſwer, the difference lies in two things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, The habitual receiving of Chriſt, is done but once; the gradual is done often. The habitual receiving of Chriſt is done but once, as the Child is born into the World but once; but it muſt be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and fed every day: ſo we are ſpiritually born, or regenerated but once; but we muſt be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and we muſt likewiſe increaſe and grow in and up to Chriſt daily; we muſt grow up to him, as the Apoſtle phraſes it, grow up into him more and more, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the habitual receiving of Chriſt, we
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45614:60"/>are meerly paſſive; a man does no more to his own regeneration, than a dead man can do to his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. But in the gradual receiving of Chriſt, we are active, we are <hi>co-workers with God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; we move towards him, when we are moved by him. The child before it is born, hath no nouriſhment but what it receives from the Mother; but when the child is born, then it hath a nutritive faculty, and is able to feed and nouriſh it ſelf. So in the firſt work of converſion, we are meerly paſſive, and do nothing at all, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all from Chriſt, and do nothing in the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the work of our ſalvation: But when once we have received a life from Chriſt, then we may act and exerciſe that life for our own good, and the glory of God. Now of both theſe receivings of Jeſus Chriſt, does the Apoſtle ſpeak, both of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual and gradual receiving of him: <hi>As you have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk in him.</hi> Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is an active motion; and when the Apoſtle ſays, Walk in him, it is as if he ſhould ſay, As you have received the truth of grace, ſo alſo be acting of your grace to the glory of Chriſt. So then, this is the meaning of the Doctrine; when I ſay, it is not enough for a Chriſtian to receive Chriſt, but he muſt alſo walk in Chriſt: the meaning of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is this. It is not enough for a Chriſtian to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace from Chriſt, but he muſt be alſo acting his grace. For the proof of this truth, let me give you two remarkable Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I put thee in remembrance, that thou ſtir up the gift of God that is in thee.</hi> I know the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Miniſterial gift; but it is as true of the work of grace; for the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies grace, as well as gift; <hi>Stir up the grace of God
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45614:60"/>in thee.</hi> Mark the phraſe, it is a remarkable phraſe; for in the original it is to blow up thy grace, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, juſt as a man blows up a fire that grows dull, or is hid under the aſhes; blow up the grace of God in thee. The other Scripture which is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to this, is that Text, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25, <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit;</hi> that is, if we have received a ſpiritual life, or influence from Chriſt, let us walk in the ſpirit, that is, let us act that ſpiritual life that we have received by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of grace: If we have received the life of grace, let us alſo act the life of grace. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter explication of this point, two things are to be briefly unfolded.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, What is required of a Chriſtian that he may act his grace, that he may walk in Chriſt?</item>
               <item>Secondly, Why muſt a Chriſtian that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived grace, be acting his grace?</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, What is required of a Chriſtian, that he may be acting of his grace? In anſwer to this, I ſhall lay down theſe five Propoſitions:</p>
            <p>Firſt, No man can act that grace he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by his own ſtrength, without the help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10, <hi>But by the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace which was beſtowed upon me was not in vain, but I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me:</hi> He does not ſay, the grace of God which was in me, that habitual grace which I had; but the grace of God which was with me. So then, it is not the ſtrength of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual grace that carries a man through any duty, but the auxiliary, the aſſiſting, the concurring grace of Jeſus Chriſt; it is his grace with us, more than his grace in us: And ſays our Saviour, ſpeaking to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45614:61"/>his Diſciples, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing,</hi> John 15.5. Ye that are my Diſciples, ye that have the ſpirit of grace, without me ye can do nothing. The habit of grace, the acting of grace, and the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of grace, are all from Jeſus Chriſt: If we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put forth a natural action without him, <hi>for in him we live, move, and have our being, Acts</hi> 17.28, how much more can we perform a ſpiritual act in a ſpiritual manner without him? <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi> Yet take this caution with you, When I ſay a man cannot act his own grace, by his own ſtrength; you muſt not therefore be lazy, and ſay, I can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt; for you muſt know, the Lord Chriſt works grace in us, by ſetting thoſe faculties that are in us on work; though we cannot work by our own ſtrength, yet we muſt be co-workers with Chriſt: ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. That which ſome perſons make an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of lazineſs, We will do nothing, ſay they, in the buſineſs of Salvation, for it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do: The Apoſtle makes it rather an argument of diligence; Nay therefore, be you working as well as God; though it is God that works in you both to will and to do, yet do you work out your ſalvation; if you put forth your ſtrength to the utmoſt, he will help you: That's the firſt Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another Propoſition is this, It is not enough to act one Grace, but Chriſtians muſt be acting every grace; for all graces proceed from the ſame fountain: <hi>We receive from Chriſts fulneſs,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45614:61"/>and grace for grace,</hi> John 1.16. Jeſus Chriſt is the fountain of all grace, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19, <hi>It pleaſeth the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> We muſt draw water from no other Fountain: you muſt not look on Faith as a diſtinct habit; or Love, or Repentance, as a diſtinct habit; as if theſe were ſeveral branches, proceeding from ſeveral roots, they all proceed from one and the ſame root: Faith is a habit of grace cloſing with Chriſt, Repentance is a habit of grace, receiving Chriſt; Love is a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of grace renewing and fitting the ſoul to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt; they all proceed therefore from one and the ſame root, and every grace muſt be acted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third Propoſition is this; It is not enough to act grace one way; but Chriſtians muſt act grace every way: we muſt not only act grace inviſibly, and inwardly, in reference to God; but we muſt act grace outwardly, and viſibly, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to men. This is that our Saviour ſpeaks of, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men;</hi> he ſpeaks of the light of grace, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, that they may ſee your good works, &amp; glorifie your Father which is in heaven:</hi> and ſays the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>James</hi> 2.18, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, There are certain ſeaſons wherein grace muſt be eſpecially acted, as there are certain ſeaſons of the year; in Spring you have buds and bloſſoms: in Summer you have fruits green, and growing: in the Autumn you have the ſame fruits ripe, and ready to be eaten; <hi>Every thing is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in its ſeaſon,</hi> Eccleſ. 3.11, <hi>He hath made every thing beautiful in his time;</hi> ſo every grace is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acted, when it is ſeaſonably acted.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He that hath the leaſt meaſure of grace, muſt not be diſcouraged, but muſt be acting it ſtill,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45614:62"/>that in the exerciſe of it it may be increaſed; nay certainly, a man that hath but one Talent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.15, that is, but a little meaſure of grace, and doth act it well, he ſhall have more comfort a great deal, than he that hath five Talents, and doth not wiſely act them. Thus you ſee the firſt thing opened, what is required of a Chriſtian that he may rightly act his grace?</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing for explication, is; But why muſt Chriſtians thus be acting of their graces? Let me give you theſe four reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The acting of grace will be a certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of grace: there is no more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain evidence of the truth of grace, than the acting of grace: it may be there are ſome poor ſouls that hear me, that will be ready to ſay, O what would I give, that I might but have a certain and infallible evidence of the truth of grace, though it were but as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed; that I could but ſay, that I have true faith, and true repentance, and true love to Jeſus Chriſt; had I an aſſurance that it were in truth, what would I give! I will tell thee for thy comfort, Here is a rule in the Text, If thou walk in Jeſus Chriſt, that is, if thou be acting that little grace thou haſt received, it is a certain token of the truth of it. A painted fire will not warm a man: a painted Cow will give no milk, a painted Horſe will not move, a painted Tree will not grow; ſo here, a painted Chriſtian, a counterfeit Chriſtian, a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, counterfeit grace will never grow; a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Chriſtian is always a dead and barren Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; but if thou art a fruitful Chriſtian, it is a token that grace that thou haſt, is grace in truth, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, <hi>And beſides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45614:62"/>and to virtue knowledg, and to knowledg temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godlineſs, and to godlineſs brotherly-kindneſs, and to brotherly-kindneſs charity; for if theſe things be in you, and abound, they make you that you ſhall neither be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, nor unfruitful in the knowledg of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> when a man is acting of his grace, he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his grace: <hi>add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledg, &amp;c.</hi> When a man is acting of his grace, then he is not barren, nor unfruitful: when theſe two go together, then may a man be confident that he is a real Chriſtian, a Diſciple indeed, and not a Diſciple in name only. There are theſe two ſpecial properties of grace, the acting of grace, and the growth of grace; and you have them both in that place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8: the activity of grace, when a man is not barren nor unfruitful in the knowledg of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: And the growth of grace, when a man adds to his faith vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to virtue knowledg, to knowledg temperance, to temperance patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Compare theſe two places of Scripture together, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15, with <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. In <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new Creature:</hi> compare that with <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6, <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which worketh by love.</hi> In the former place, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15, <hi>but a new creature:</hi> there the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the habit of grace, in the latter, namely <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6, <hi>but faith which worketh by love,</hi> there he ſpeaks of the activity of grace: when the habit of grace is turned into the activity of grace, when faith worketh by love, that is a token of true graceindeed.</p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon is this, The more you act your
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45614:63"/>graces the more you ſhall encreaſe them. Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men know, the more they trade with their Stock, the more they increaſe their Stock: Grace is like the Windows oyl, the more it is poured out, the more it is increaſed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.6. Nay, there is a promiſe made to that man that doth well uſe his grace, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.29, <hi>For unto every one that hath, ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance;</hi> which place muſt be rightly underſtood; our Saviour ſpeaks there of gifts of the ſame kind, and ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; otherwiſe we will run into the <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> opinion, which is, That the well-uſing of the gifts of nature, will merit the gifts of grace; ſo the <hi>Arminian</hi> would have the meaning of the words to be; he that well uſes the gifts of nature, to him ſhall be given the gifts of grace. Our Saviour there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>peaks no ſuch matter; but he ſpeaks thus, he that hath ſaving-grace, ſhall have more ſaving-grace: that man that hath ſaving-grace, by well-uſing of it, ſhall have more ſaving-grace: as a man, the more he plays upon an Inſtrument, the more dextrous he grows, the more cunning and skilful he will be: So here, the more you act your graces, the more a great deal ſhall you increaſe them: <hi>to him that hath, ſhall be given; and he ſhall have abundance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, A third reaſon is this, Becauſe God hath given grace for that very end, that it may be acted: If God hath given thee grace, it is not that thou ſhouldſt hide it, like a Candle under a Buſhel; nor for thee to put in a dark Lanthorn; but that thou ſhouldſt ſet it upon a Table for the advantage and benefit of others: <hi>But the manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man to profit withal,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.17. And in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good
<pb facs="tcp:45614:63"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45614:64"/>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:45614:64"/>ſtewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi> And why are we ſaid to be Stewards of the manifold grace of God? becauſe we ſhould be diſpenſing them, as Stewards that have their Maſters goods, not to put them in their own purſes, or to convert them to their own advantage; but to be diſpenſing of them, and diffuſing them for their Maſters advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; we are Stewards of the manifold grace of God: look, as God gives to ſome more riches than to others, becauſe he would have them to be more rich in good works than others: ſo he gives to ſome more grace than he gives to others, becauſe he would have them diffuſive of grace, making others rich in grace. He gives to ſome more comforts than he gives to others, becauſe he would have them <hi>to comfort others with the ſame comforts wherewith they themſelves are comforted of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, 5. The grace of God is given for this end, to diſpence to others.</p>
            <p>Fourtly, A fourth reaſon is this; If you do not act your graces, God ſhall loſe his glory; and his glory ſhould be dearer to you than your liberty, and all your outward comforts. It is a true ſpeech of him that ſaid, the truth of grace doth ſave my ſoul, but the acting of grace makes for the honour of God; the truth of Grace makes for my ſafety, but the acting of grace makes for the ſervice of God, in the place I am in. Now a child of God hath the glory of God lying near his heart: ſays a child of God, I would loſe my life rather than the end of my life: I would be uſefully ſpent for God, for the honour of God, for the name of God, in living, in ſuffering, in dying, rather than to enjoy all the honours, or pleaſures, or treaſures that the world can afford. Thus you ſee the point opened and made good to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:45614:65"/>Now for the Uſe of it, and there are three Uſes I ſhall make of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Information: If they that have grace, muſt be acting, and increaſing of it, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it follows, That they that have no grace, had need to get it: If they that have received Chriſt Jeſus, muſt walk in him; then they that have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, certainly they have great need, infinite need, to cloſe with him. O the miſerable, and dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and damnable condition of all thoſe that for the preſent are in a Chriſtleſs condition, in a graceleſs condition! no tongue of men or Angels is able ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to expreſs it; no tears of blood can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently bewail it. If any of you die in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you muſt reſolve to die everlaſtingly, and to ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire, <hi>Jude</hi> 7. you muſt reſolve to be ſatisfying of a ſin-revenging God in hell, and yet never be able to ſatisfie him; you muſt be always dying, and yet never die, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6, <hi>And in thoſe days ſhall men ſeek death, and ſhall not find it: and ſhall deſire to die, and death ſhall flee from them:</hi> This will be the condition of all thoſe that die Chriſtleſs, that die graceleſs, that have not received Chriſt into their hearts, and that have not got grace into their hearts, oyl into their lamps; they ſhall be alway dying, and yet never die: O with what weeping, and wailing, and wringing of their hands, and tearing of their hair, and renting of the cawl of their hearts, ſhall they cry out, O that I might dye, and dye, and never have a being more! O that I might dye the moſt curſed, the moſt tormenting, the moſt painful death that ever crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on earth dyed, ſo I may but dye: But this is the miſery of all miſery, I live to dye, and muſt live eternally! This is the condition of all thoſe that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45614:65"/>have not got Chriſt in their hearts: O then! why do you reſt in ſuch a condition one week, nay, one day! O, if ever there were any love to your ſouls kindled in your breaſts, any deſire of ſalvation wrought in you, any care of eſcaping thoſe uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable tortures and torments, reſolve to receive Jeſus Chriſt upon his own terms, and ſay, O Lord, rule in me as thou pleaſeſt, ſo I may be but thine; reſolve to receive him as a Prince, as well as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. It was a point I preſſed upon you with all my might, from <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31, Receive Jeſus Chriſt to give you repentance, as well as remiſſion of ſins: He is a <hi>Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and forgiveneſs of ſins:</hi> He gives repentance, before he gives remiſſion; if he gives nor repentance for ſin, he never gives remiſſion of ſin: O reſolve to trade for him; ſome of you know no other trade, but to treade in the world, to be tumbling up and down in dirt, and clay, and to provide for your Families: a Heathen man may do as much as you do: O that you would be perſwaded to drive a Trade for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for grace, for ſaving-grace. That which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeaks of wiſdom, I may ſay of every grace, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.7, <hi>Wiſdom is the principal thing, therefore get wiſdom; and with all thy getting, get underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> So ſay I, grace is the principal thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with all thy getting, get grace: It is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though thou be poor in the World, if thou beeſt rich in grace; If thou ſhouldſt be rich in the World, and get thy Coffers full of gold and ſilver, yet if thou get no grace in thy heart, it had been better that thou hadſt never been born.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By way of reproof; Here is a juſt and ſharp reproof, even of Gods own children, that have received Chriſt, and yet do not walk in him,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45614:66"/>do not <hi>walk worthy of him in all well-pleaſing;</hi> that have received grace, and yet do not act grace, but rather wrap it up like a Talent in a Napkin: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak it without indignation, How many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are there, ſome of whom I am really perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they are the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, yet they are ſick of a ſpiritual Lethargy, Appoplexy: they are in a ſpiritual ſlumber; a man in an Appoplex hath his reaſon, he is a reaſonable man, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make uſe of his reaſon: what is man the better for his wealth, if he does not make uſe of his wealth? ſo, what am I the better for grace, if I do not make uſe of it for the glory of God, and the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? In <hi>Matth.</hi> 25, you read, the five wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins ſlumbered, as well as the five fooliſh: It is a ſad thing, when even Gods own children, true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, ſhall be ſlumbering; yet the five wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins ſlumbered, as well as the five fooliſh. Yet this is the condition of the Servants of God at this day; I can hardly meet with any, but their grace is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, they are fallen aſleep: their activity for for God, and their acting of grace, is lull'd aſleep. I pray God he do not thunder againſt us, as once the Mariners did to <hi>Jonah; What meaneſt thou, O ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? ariſe, call upon thy God, if ſo be that God will think upon us, that we periſh not,</hi> Jonah 1.6. When the wind roars, and the waters rage, and the ſtorms ariſe, and there is but a ſtep between thee &amp; death, and thou aſleep, is it not a ſhame for thee to be ſnorting when the ſhip is in danger of ſinking? ſo may it be ſaid of all us who are aſleep in ſecurity; I pray God that he do not awake us with a ruſhing wind. It may be the rod may come ſooner on us than we are aware, and a ſharper rod than we are aware of. Oh that I could but awaken my own
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45614:66"/>ſoul, then I might hope to help to awaken you out of this ſpiritual ſlumber; then you would ſay to me as <hi>David</hi> did to <hi>Abigail, Bleſſed be God, and bleſſed be thou, that haſt given me this counſel this day,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.32, 33. Bleſſed be God that thou haſt awakened me out of my ſloth and ſecurity.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Uſe it is for Exhortation: If ſo be it is not enough for Chriſtians to receive Chriſt, and to receive grace, but they muſt be walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt, and they muſt be acting of their grace; then I beſeech you to hearken to the counſel of the Apoſtle here: I cannot give you the exhortation in better words than theſe in the Text, <hi>As ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him.</hi> Oh be walking in Chriſt; Oh be acting of your grace, Oh be ſtirring up your ſelves to take hold of God; Oh be ſtirring up the grace of God that is in you; Oh be active Chriſtians, be not ſleepy Chriſtians, be not dull, drowſie, dead-hearted in matters of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting ſalvation: You have but little time to ſpend, and you have need to ſpend it well; every day brings you nearer your graves, Oh that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day might bring you nearer to God; God is continually acting for you; he is an overflowing, and an ever-flowing Fountain of goodneſs; God is continually renewing his mercy upon you; Jeſus Chriſt is continually interceding for you; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is continually knocking at the dore of your hearts: And is God acting for you, and will you act nothing for God?</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider, Wicked men they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually acting for Satan, continually doing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils drudgery: what a ſhame is it, that wicked men ſhould take more pains to go to hell, than Gods children ſhould take to go to heaven? <hi>Judas</hi> was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45614:67"/>as buſie as could be that night to betray his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, plotting and contriving how to betray Chriſt into the hands of the Jews: when the reſt of his Diſciples were ſleeping, <hi>Judas</hi> was waking to do the Devils work. I beſeech you, let not wicked men riſe up in judgment againſt you; let not them be more vigorous and active in the work of ſin, than you are in the work of grace and holineſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider, If you be not acting your graces, God may juſtly leave you to be acting your corruptions; if you be not acting one way, you will be acting another way: if you be not acting grace, be ſure the Devil will ſet you on work to be grinding of his griſt. The mind of man is like a Mill, it is always grinding Chaff, or Wheat: if you be not doing Gods work, you will be doing Satans work. On the contrary; ſee what the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Gal,</hi> 5.16, <hi>This I ſay then, walk in the ſpirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſt of the fleſh.</hi> Be walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſpirit, be acting the grace you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, then you ſhall not fulfil the luſt of the fleſh; though it is true, thoſe luſts of the fleſh, and curſed corruptions, will be ſtirring in you; yet you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fulfil the luſts of the fleſh: It may be you may be drawn to act them, to be ſold under ſin; as the poor captive is carried into captivity againſt his mind and will, ſo you may be held under ſin, and carried captive by it; but you will never willingly fulfil the luſt of the fleſh. But then, may be you will ſay, What means, or helps, or directions can you preſcribe to this end, that we may act grace? Briefly in anſwer to this, and ſo I have done.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, I will ſhew you in whoſe ſtrength you muſt act grace.</item>
               <item>Secondly, In what manner you muſt act grace.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:45614:67"/>Thirdly, In what ſeaſons you muſt act grace.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, in whoſe ſtrength you muſt act grace; I told you before, no man can do it in his own ſtrength; therefore you muſt go out of your ſelves, and run to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.3, <hi>I taught Ephraim alſo to go, taking them by their Arm.</hi> God does not only give us ſpiritual life, but he alſo gives us ſtrength: He did not only give <hi>Ephraim</hi> life, but he gave him ſtrength; <hi>I taught Ephraim to go, leading them by the arm.</hi> I remember the ſpeech of <hi>Sampſon, Judges</hi> 16.20, when his locks were cut off, the Text ſays, <hi>And he awoke out of his ſleep, and ſaid, I will go out as at other times before, and ſhake my ſelf, and he wiſt not that the Lord was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him.</hi> I may apply it thus, Many times we ſet about duty in our own ſtrength, and we think to do ſuch and ſuch duties, as before; but alas! when the ſpirit of God is withdrawn, we are as weak as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was when his locks were cut off. On the contrary, <hi>Let the King ſit but at his table, then our Spicknard ſendeth forth the ſmell thereof, Cant.</hi> 1.12; that is, let Jeſus Chriſt be but with us, then our graces, which are compared to Spick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, ſend forth a ſweet ſmell. If the wind blow upon our Garden, that is, the ſpirit of God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſoul, (<hi>Awake O North-wind, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out,</hi> Cant. 4.16.) then the ſpices will flow forth. If the Sun ſhine upon the Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold, how ſoon does the Mary-gold open: Oh make ſure of the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt with you; ſay, Lord, let me have thy grace with me, as well as thy grace in me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I will ſhew you how, or in what manner you muſt act Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:45614:68"/>Firſt, You muſt act your Graces evenly, not by girds and ſtarts; Walking, we ſay, is an equal, and even Motion: ſome there are, that are very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that will run for a quarter of a mile, then they ſit down, having run themſelves out of breath; this is the caſe of many forward Profeſſors; Oh, they ſeem for a while to be very zealous God-ward, and Grace-ward, but then they faint, and flag, and grow weary of the ways of God. See what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.112, <hi>I have inclined mine heart to perform thy ſtatutes always, even unto the end:</hi> That is a right acting of Grace indeed, a man that reſolves to keep Gods ſtatutes alway to the end; <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy ſtatutes, and I ſhall keep it unto the end,</hi> in <hi>verſe</hi> 33 of the ſame Pſalm.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As you muſt act Grace evenly, ſo you muſt act it orderly: that is, you muſt not turn aſide either to the right hand, or to the left: This is one of Gods own commands, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.32, <hi>Ye ſhall obſerve to do therefore, as the Lord your God hath commanded you; you ſhall not turn aſide to the right hand, or to the left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, You muſt act your Grace Evangellically, to do all your duties from Chriſt, by Chriſt, and to Chriſt; from Chriſt as the Root, by Chriſt as the Rule, and to Chriſt as the end: Let Chriſt be the Spring, let him be the Guide, and let him be the Centre of all your actings.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, See that you act all your Graces like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe couragiouſly, that you may ſay, Nothing ſhall daunt me, or diſcourage me in the way that I have undertaken. As <hi>David</hi> in the buſineſs of his dancing before the Lord, which was an evidence of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great zeal, when <hi>Michal</hi> ſcoft at him, ſav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:45614:68"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:45614:69"/>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:45614:69"/>he, <hi>I will yet be more vile than thus, and be more baſe in my own ſight,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.27. Laſtly, Act Grace humbly; when you have done all that you can do, ſay you are unprofitable ſervants, and ſay with St. <hi>Paul, It was not I, but the grace of God which was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I ſhall ſhew you in what ſeaſons you muſt act Grace; certainly Grace muſt be acted at all times, but there are ſome ſpecial ſeaſons wherein we muſt eſpecially act Grace.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Upon the receipt of ſome ſpecial Mercy, then we ſhould act Thankfulneſs more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and ſay, <hi>What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me!</hi> Pſal. 116.12. Is Gods hand enlarged in bounty? then let my heart be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged with thankfulneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When you lye under a ſmarting Rod, a piercing Affliction, then act Faith and Patience: A man uſually never acts Grace better, than when he is under ſome abaſement; a ſoul can better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a ſtate of adverſity, than it can a ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; for when it is in a ſtate of abaſement, then it is at a leſs diſtance from God; as Roſes, they are never ſo ſweet, as when they are in a Still, and fire is under them; never does our Graces uſually ſend forth a ſweeter favour, than when God is pleaſed to exerciſe us with Afflictions: <hi>David</hi> was never bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than when he was under the Rod; then he made thoſe heavenly ſoul raviſhing Pſalms, that you meet with in the book of Pſalms; The beſt Pſalms, the moſt heavenly and ſpiritual Pſalms were made when <hi>David</hi> was in a low condition; witneſs the 34 Pſalm, its one of the ſweeteſt Pſalms you meet with: when was it made? when <hi>David</hi> was in the loweſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ever he was in; when he was in that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45614:70"/>ſtraight, he was forced to feign himſelf mad, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.13. See how <hi>Davids</hi> heart was enlarged in the making of this Pſalm.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another fit ſeaſon to act Grace in, is, when you receive the ſeals of the Covenant of Grace in the uſe of the holy Ordinance of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; that is a time for you to act Grace in; then ſhould you be acting brokenneſs of heart: for, can you look upon a broken Saviour without a broken heart? upon a bleeding Saviour without a bleeding heart? then ſhould you be acting Humility, and ſay as <hi>Mephiboſheth, What is thy ſervant, that thou ſhouldſt look upon ſuch a dead dog as I am?</hi> 2 Sam. 9.8. Nay, but here is more, that thou ſhouldſt not only look on me, but ſet me at thy Table! what, a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, a loathſom leprous beggar, to ſit at the Table of the King of Glory!</p>
            <p>Then act Love to Jeſus Chriſt: what, hath he loved me ſo dearly! Oh, how ſhould I love him above all expreſſions of love, and be ſick of love to him!</p>
            <p>Then act Faith eſpecially, for that is a grace you have moſt need of when you come to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as now, faith is the very eye whereby we look upon him; it is the hand whereby we receive him; it is the mouth whereby we feed on him: ſays Chriſt, <hi>except you eat my fleſh, and drink my blood, you have no life in you.</hi> Joh. 6.52, 53. He does not here ſpeak of a Corporal eating of him; far be it from us to have ſuch a thought as they of <hi>Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> had; <hi>how can this man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> that man that believes in Chriſt, he feeds on Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Then be acting of Thankfulneſs, after you have received the Lords Supper: Oh, what thanks ſhall I return to the Lord my God! Oh! my whole
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45614:70"/>courſe of life ſhould be nothing but a continual gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation to my Father, for that never-ſufficiently admired gift of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; If I had ten thouſand thouſand tongues, I could never praiſe him ſufficiently!</p>
            <p>Then act holy Reſignation of your ſelves up to Chriſt; what, did the Lord give himſelf for me! I will give my ſelf up to him: was he crucified for my ſins! I will crucifie my ſins for him. Study confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to him, and that will evidence that you have Communion with him: There is no more certain evidence of our Communion with Chriſt in his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Comforts, Merits, and Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than in our conformity to him: when we reſemble him in Grace here, it is a certain evidence that we ſhall reſemble him in Glory hereafter. In one word, do but make it your buſineſs to be acting your Grace, and you may truſt God for the bringing in of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; the more you are active in Grace, the more ſhall be your Comfort: If we had more activity of Grace, we ſhould have more evidence of Chriſts dwelling in our hearts here; and God would have more Glory, our ſouls would have more peace, and we ſhould have abundance of more rejoycing in the day of our Lord Jeſus.</p>

            <p>THE ſcope of the Apoſtle in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter is to prove that Jeſus Chriſt is truly God, therefore far above the Angels; for ſays he in the fifth verſe of that Chapter, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?</hi> In this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apoſtle proves that Jeſus Chriſt is truly man, and therefore in that reſpect inferiour to the Angels, Verſe 9, <hi>But we ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of death,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45614:71"/>crowned with glory and honour.</hi> And becauſe it might be demanded, But why is it needful that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhould be man? why did he not take on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> Verſe 16. The Apoſtle give us four reaſons, why our bleſſed Saviour would be man, why he took our human nature upon him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He did it for the ſanctification of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that reaſon is ſet down in v. 11, <hi>For both be that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one;</hi> that is, they are all of one and the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: we come all from one common root; Chriſt came from the ſame root that we did, namely from <hi>Adam;</hi> and this he did, that he might ſanctifie our nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt became man, that he might in our nature, and for our benefit, deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devil: that is ſet down in Verſe 14, <hi>Foraſmuch then as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, He became man, that he might deliver us not only from the hurt of death, but deliver us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from the fear of death; and that's ſet down in Verſe 15, <hi>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their life-time ſubject to bondage.</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, He became man, that by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his ſufferings in our nature, he might be <hi>a merciful and faithful High-prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people;</hi> and that's ſet down in Verſe 17. And the ground of this Aſſertion the Apoſtle lays down in the words of the Text, which I have now read unto you, <hi>For in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45614:72"/>that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> So then the Text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it a ſingular benefit and advantage that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have by Chriſts temptations, namely, a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied uſe of temptations, and a gracious ſupport un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der temptations. For the clearing of this, you muſt know, all that ever our Lord and Saviour did here upon earth as Mediator, was done not for himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; but was done for us, and for our good. For example, He took our fleſh in the womb of a Virgin, that he might ſanctifie our nature: He was born of a woman, that he might ſanctifie our birth: He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the fleſh, that he might ſanctifie our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; He was buried in a grave, that he might ſweeten and perfume the grave, that he might make the grave as a bed of ſpices; He roſe again from the dead, that he might aſſure us that we ſhall be raiſed by his power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, <hi>And God hath both raiſed up the Lord, and will alſo raiſe up us by his own power:</hi> And he was tempted, that he might be able to ſuccour us when we are tempted. Let me firſt open the words to you, and then draw out the Doctrine I intend to pitch upon. I ſhall diſpatch this Text in one Sermon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered indeed; He was a great ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; nay, the greateſt ſufferer that you read of in the whole book of God: He ſuffered in his Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: when he was but eight days old, he cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcended to that painful Ceremony, that painful Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: He ſuffered a painful pilgrimage for three and thirty years together; and although he was. heir of all things, all the Kingdoms of the world were his, yet he had not a houſe to hide his head in; <hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45614:72"/>neſts, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head</hi> Mat. 8.20. He ſuffered by Satan when he was led into the Wilderneſs to be tempted for forty days together, which was a greater abaſement to the Son of God, than if the greateſt Empreſs in the world ſhould be ſolicited in her chaſtity by the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Scullion that ever was. Oh how did Satan hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the body of our dear Lord and Saviour, firſt to the pinacle of the Temple, then he hurried it to a Mountain, and carried it from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! Oh that the precious body of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be thus baſely uſed, by a Vaſſal, by a curſed Fiend, by a curſed creature! So he ſuffered by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
            <p>And he ſuffered by men; he ſuffered the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of ſinners; he ſuffered himſelf to be reviled, ſcorned, reproached, blaſphemeed, when they ſaid, <hi>Say we not well, Thou art a Samaritan, and haſt a Devil?</hi> Joh. 8.48, And <hi>he is mad, and hath a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, why hear ye him?</hi> Joh. 10.20. He ſuffered on the Croſs a ſhameful, painful, and curſed death; He ſuffered in his body, but moſt of all he ſuffered in his ſoul, when he ſaid, <hi>My ſoul is heavy unto death,</hi> is girt about with death, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.27, <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled, and what ſhall I ſay?</hi> He ſpeaks as if he had been non-pluſt; My ſoul is ſo troubled, ſays he, that I know not what to ſay, I know not what to do. So you ſee the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Further, the Text ſays <hi>he ſuffered being tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt you know was tempted by Satan for forty days together, and he was tempted by his Enemies: the Phariſes they required a ſign of him, tempting of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.16. Then he was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Herodians,</hi> when they came with that captious queſtion, <hi>Shall we give tribute to Caeſar, or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:45614:73"/>ſhall we not?</hi> Mat. 22.17, 18. Chriſt anſwered them, <hi>Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</hi> He was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one of his Diſciples, <hi>Peter;</hi> ſays he to him, <hi>Maſter; ſpare thy ſelf, and do not go up to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> inſomuch that Chriſt ſharply reproved him, and ſaid to him, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me, for thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men,</hi> Mat. 16.22, 23. And he was tempted even by his own dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when his Father hid his face from him, when he ſeemingly did forſake him, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Mat. 27.46, So you ſee, that our Saviour ſuffered, and our Saviour was tempted: And why was he tempted? <hi>that he might ſuccour them that are tempted, ſaye the Text.</hi> Why, may ſome ſay, did the ſufferings and temptations of Jeſus Chriſt add any thing to his ability to ſuccour his tempted Servants, which he had not before? To this I anſwer, You muſt know he had an ability of Power, which was irreſiſtable; he had an ability of Power, as he was God: but the Apoſtle ſpeaks here, of an ability of Compaſſion, or of an ability of Experience, as he was man; as he ſays in the like caſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8, <hi>He learned obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by the things which he ſuffered:</hi> How did he learn it? he learnt it experimentally: So here, by his ſuffering, and temptations, he learnt to ſuccour them that are tempted; he learnt compaſſion by his temptations: How did he learn compaſſion? he learnt it experimentally; for now he hath learned by experience, to know the kinds of temptations, to know the wounds that temptations make in the ſoul of a poor ſinner, and to know the proper means and medicines for the curing of temptations: ſo that if you ask, But why was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45614:73"/>tempted? I anſwer, he was tempted for theſe three ends eſpecially.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he might teach us this Leſſon: If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan was ſo bold with him that was the dear Son of God, he will be much more bold in tempting us poor creatures; If he was ſo bold with the Maſter, much more will he be bold with the Servants; If he were ſo bold with the Captain of our ſalvation, much more will he be bold with his Soldiers; If he were ſo bold in tempting him who was the King of glory, a pure and ſpotleſs Saviour, a Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh, in whoſe mouth could be found no guile, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. Oh, he will be much more bold with us, that are poor ſinful creatures, that have ſuch impure and defiled natures: <hi>How abominable and filthy is man!</hi> Job 15.16. When the Devil came to tempt our Lord and Saviour, he found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him, he found no matter to work upon, he found no corruption on which he might faſten his temptation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.30, <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.</hi> All the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan upon our Saviour were but like the jog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of pure and clean water in a Chryſtal glaſs, where is no mud at all: but now Satan never comes to us, but he finds matter enough, and ground enough to work upon; there is a great deal of mud at the bottom, therefore he prevails on us when he comes. But that is one end, that he may teach us to expect temptations, he himſelf was tempted: then certainly much more muſt we expect to be tempted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt was tempted, that he might know how to compaſſionate us in our temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He was tempted, that he might take
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45614:74"/>out the ſting, the poiſon, the venom of every temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that though we be ſorely aſſaulted by Satan, yet we may not be conquered by Satan. That that <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Saul,</hi> Pſal. 188.13, <hi>Thou haſt thruſt ſore at me, that I might fall, but the Lord help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me.</hi> The like may Believers ſay of Satan, Thou haſt thruſt ſore at me, if it were poſſible to thruſt me into hell, but the Lord is my helper; nay, God can ſo order it, when Satan thruſts his foreſt darts at us, he can ward off the blow, or at leaſt ſo order the temptation, that it ſhall kill our ſins, and not hurt our ſouls. As I have read a ſtory of one <hi>Pareus Jaſon,</hi> who was conflicting with his adverſary, when his adverſary thought to have run him through with his ſword, God did ſo order it, that it did open an impoſthumation, which all Phyſicians could not heal, ſo that inſtead of killing of him, he preſerved his life; ſo God can ſo order it, when Satan is thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorely at us with his temptations, they ſhall kill our ſins, but ſhall not hurt our ſouls. So then the words being opened to you, the way to the Doctrine is made plain, which is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſts temptations and his ſufferings for us, ſtir up in his heart a tender compaſſion to ſuccour us in our temptations, and in our fufferings.</p>
            <p>That which God commands <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is ſuitable to this, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.9, <hi>Alſo thou ſhalt not oppreſs a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for ye know the heart of a ſtranger, ſeeing ye were ſtrangers in the land of Egypt.</hi> So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt knows the hearts of tempted ones, and knows how to pity tempted ones, becauſe he himſelf was tempted. That which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4, <hi>God comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelves are comforted
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45614:74"/>of God.</hi> I may apply it thus: The Lord Jeſus Chriſt knows how to ſuccour us, to comfort us, to ſupport us in our temptations, with the ſame ſpirit that he had in his ſufferings, and in his temptations, though his temptations were ſo great, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf needed an Angel to come and comfort him. For the better explication of this point, there are two Quaeries that would be ſatisfied.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, Why Chriſts ſufferings and temptations ſtir up in his heart ſuch tender compaſſion towards us, to ſuccour and relieve us in our temptations and ſufferings?</item>
               <item>Secondly, How the Lord Jeſus Chriſt does ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and relieve poor tempted ones, in their diſtrſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſufferings?</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, Why does Chriſts ſufferings and temptations, ſtir up in his heart ſuch tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions towards us? I anſwer, The reaſon is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this; becauſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt his ſuffering in our Nature, makes him not only a merciful God, but a merciful Man alſo; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as he is God equal with the Father to all Eternity, ſo <hi>his mercies are from everlaſting to everlaſting,</hi> Pſal. 103.17. But now his ſufferings in our fleſh, makes him not only a merciful God, but a merciful man alſo, a merciful Mediator between God and man; ſo he hath not only beams of Majeſty, but bowels of mercy; his ſufferings made him a merciful High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, that is touched with the ſenſe of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as you read <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, for (ſays he) <hi>We have not an High prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered all our natural infirmities, though he did not ſuffer our ſinful infirmities; He was tempted
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45614:75"/>in all things like unto us, yet without ſin: a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful High-prieſt he is: and this is that, that makes him ſo tender-hearted to the ſufferings and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his People: Oh, what bowels of compaſſion hath Jeſus Chriſt towards the ſouls of poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.36, the Text ſays, <hi>When he ſaw the multitude, he was moved with compaſſion on them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they fainted and were ſcattered abroad as ſheep having no ſhepheard;</hi> His bowels did earn towards them, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies; he had compaſſion on their ſouls, becauſe they wanted thoſe that might inſtruct them in the way of life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. And what compaſſion had he on the bodies of poor ones, that waited on his Doctrine? <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.32, <hi>Then Jeſus called his diſciples to him, and ſaid, I have compaſſion on the multitude, becauſe they have continued with me now three days, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat, and I will not ſend them away ſaſting, leſt they faint in the way.</hi> And what compaſſion had he towards the poor Widow, that had loſt her only ſon, and they were now carrying him to the Grave; the Text ſays, he had compaſſion on her, his Bowels did earn towards the poor Widow; therefore he touched the Coffin and raiſed him up again, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.13. Look as a Child-bearing woman, that hath felt the bitter pangs and pains of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, hath more compaſſion towards a woman in that diſtreſs, than a barren woman that never felt thoſe pangs and ſorrows; or, as a man that hath been ſorely afflicted with the Gout or Stone, piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another man that is afflicted with the ſame diſeaſe, more than one that never felt the torment of that diſeaſe; and as it is ſtoried of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when ſhe paſt once through an Hoſpital where ſhe ſaw many poor Orphans, and Fatherleſs, and helpleſs
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45614:75"/>Children; Oh, ſays ſhe, I was once an Orphan, a poor helpleſs creature when I was ſhut up in priſon, therefore, ſays ſhe, I have taſted of the ſufferings of Orphans, and I cannot but be merciful to Orphans: and as it is ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> That he was a rare and and excellent man in comforting afflicted conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thoſe that were tempted and afflicted, why? becauſe he himſelf was exerciſed with temptations for three years together; ſo here, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is a moſt rare and excellent Comforter, a Phyſician good at all diſeaſes, eſpecially at binding up broken hearts, and comforting tempted ſouls; why, becauſe he himſelf had experience of the ſting and venom of temptations: but ſome may ſay, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is now in heaven: hath he not left the bowels that he had on earth? I anſwer, No, the Text ſays, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9, <hi>In all their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: in his love, and in his pitty he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</hi> Act. 9.4, the Lord Chriſt cryes out, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> when a man treads upon another mans little toe, the tongue complains, why do you hurt me? Jeſus Chriſt when he is now in heaven, he complains of himſelf being perſecuted in his Members, he hath ſuch a ſimpathy with them, That's the firſt Quaery.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It may be demanded, How does Jeſus Chriſt ſuccour and relieve his ſervants in their temptations? I anſwer, he ſuccours and relieves them theſe five ways.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By diſcovering to them that it is a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for many there are that miſliſte their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſome take temptations for the impulſeſs, or impreſſes of Gods ſpirit, not conſidering that there
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45614:76"/>are tempting providences, as well as approving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences: ſuch a providence was that which you read of, when <hi>David</hi> had <hi>Saul</hi> at an advantage, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.8, When <hi>Saul</hi> lay ſleeping in his trench, and his ſpear ſtuck in the ground at his bolſter, then ſaid <hi>Abiſhai</hi> to <hi>David, God hath delivered thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into thy hand this day: now therefore let me ſmite him, I pray thee, with the ſpear, even to the earth at once, and I will not ſmite him the ſecond time: Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhai</hi> thought that this was an approving medicine, that God had delivered <hi>Saul</hi> into the hands of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and now he may be avenged upon him, and cut his throat, and ſmite him preſently; nay, nay, ſays <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> deſtroy him not; for who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lords anointed, and be guiltleſs? <hi>David</hi> ſaw it was a tempting-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, not an approving-providence; he would not have a hand in his blood; he would not ſlay the Lords anointed, though his enemy, though a wicked man, though a man guilty of blood, for he had ſlain Fourſcore of the Lords Prieſts at one time, commanding <hi>Doeg</hi> to fall upon them and deſtroy them: But ſays <hi>David,</hi> I will not have a hand in the blood of the Lords anointed, though he hath delivered him into my hand: this was but a tempting-providence, not an approving-providence: this is a certain Rule, that there are tempting provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences as well as approving-providences; to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low providence without the Word, is dangerous; to follow providence againſt the Word, is damnable; but to follow providence with the Word, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſafe and comfortable: now <hi>David</hi> he had a providence here, but he had not the Word of God going along with that providence, and therefore he looks upon it as a tempting-providence. Now Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:45614:76"/>Chriſt ſuccours his people by diſcovering to them which is a tempting-providence, and which is an approving-providence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord Chriſt ſuccours and relieves them by his Gracious Supportation; he does ſupport them under their tryals; that is a precious Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that tempted ones ſhould be continually medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating upon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13, <hi>There hath no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken you, but ſuch as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that you may be able to bear it.</hi> God ſometimes draws the Bow to the Arrow head, but he will not break the Bow; if God lays heavy loads on poor tempted ones, then he will make their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſo much the ſtronger by his Gracious Manuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or holding them by the hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.23, <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I am continually with thee, thou haſt holden me by my right hand:</hi> And when God holds a poor temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſoul by the right hand, <hi>though he fall, he ſhall not utterly be caſt down, becauſe the Lord upholds him,</hi> Pſal. 37.24.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Jeſus Chriſt relieves and ſuccours tempted ones by his gracious interceſſion; for he ſits at the right hand of God to make interceſſion for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, and if ſo be thou art but one that does but deſire to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and take hold of him, though it be but with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hand, know thus much for thy comfort, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry temptation that thou meeteſt with, Jeſus Chriſt does nominate thee to his Father, he nominates thee in particular, and he ſays to thee as he did to <hi>Peter, I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not,</hi> Luke 22.32.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Jeſus Chriſt does ſuccour and relieve
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45614:77"/>tempted ones by making a diverſion ſome way or other of them; by a leſs temptation ſometimes he prevents a greater, that would even cruſh a poor ſoul to pieces; ſometimes by an outward affliction upon the body, he prevents a greater affliction and trouble that would lye upon the ſpirit: It is better a thouſand times to be afflicted in the body, than afflicted in the mind.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Lord Chriſt doth ſuccour tempted ones by a gracious Abolition, as I may call it; by a total removal of the temptation, when he treads Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan under our feet, as he hath promiſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20, <hi>And the God of peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your feet ſhortly.</hi> And when he gives Charge to Satan, as he did to him concerning the poor Child that was poſſeſſed with a dumb and deaf ſpirit, <hi>I charge thee that thou come out of him, and that thou enter into him no more,</hi> Mark. 9.25. Thus you have the point opened: Now briefly to apply it, two Uſes I ſhall make of it. Friſt for Information. Secondly for Conſolation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For information: you may learn this Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by way of Inference, That Gods own people, his Elect, true Believers, muſt look for temptations, nay they muſt look for divers temptations, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.12, <hi>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers temptations:</hi> in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 6, <hi>Wherein ye greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, though now for a ſeaſon if need be, ye are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs through manifold temptations.</hi> They muſt look for temptations of all ſorts; as the Apoſtle ſaith in the like caſe, <hi>All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution:</hi> ſo all that will live godly, muſt look for temptations. Gods People may be tempted theſe four ways:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sometimes they may be tempted by their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:45614:77"/>godly friends; ſo was St.<hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 11.12, when the Prophet <hi>Agabus</hi> foretold, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be bound at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſuffer ſo many things of the Jews: <hi>Pauls</hi> godly friends diſſwaded him from going thither: but <hi>Paul</hi> lookt upon it as a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for, ſays he in the next verſe, <hi>What mean ye to weep, and to break my heart? for I am ready, not to be bound only, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem for the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Acts 21.13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods people are ſometimes tempted by wicked men, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was by his wanton and laſcivious Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Gods people are tempted ſometimes by Satan, they are tempted to preſumption on the one hand, and to deſperation on the other hand: For theſe are two great Rocks upon which thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſouls ſuffer ſhipwrack; but there are more that periſh on the rock of Preſumption, than of Deſperation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Gods Children are ſometimes tempted by God himſelf: it is ſaid, God tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Abraham</hi> to try him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.1, <hi>And it came to paſs after theſe things, that God did tempt Abraham: and ſaid unto him, Abraham; and he ſaid, behold, here I am:</hi> But yet remember this withal, God tempts only by way of probation, God does not tempt by way of ſeduction: God tempts none but by way of probation. If it be ſo, then Chriſtians ſhould be expecting temptations: when you foreſee a dart that is ſhot againſt you, you may the more eaſily avoid it; if you be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned, you may the more eaſily be fore-armed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Uſe, it is for Confolation; Here is matter of unſpeakable comfort to all tempted ones: It may be I ſpeak to ſome ſuch in this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45614:78"/>this day. We find every Lords day ſome that ſend their Bills to be prayed for, that are bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and bruiſed with temptations. Now I do not know one portion of Scripture in the whole Book of God, that affords more ſweet Soul-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting comfort, than this Text: though you ſee matter of diſcouragement to you from your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, yet you may look for matter of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from Chriſts temptations. Art thou tempted to diſtruſt thy adoption, whether thou art a child of God, or no? ſo was Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> If thou art tempted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt the Providence of God, ſo was Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>If thou be the Son of God, command that theſe ſtones be made bread,</hi> when he was led into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and was there forty days, and had nothing to eat. Art thou tempted to preſumption? ſo was Jeſus Chriſt, that he ſhould caſt himſelf down headlong from the pinacle of the Temple. Art thou tempted to ſelf-murther? ſo was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when Satan would have had him caſt himſelf down from the pinacle of the Temple to deſtroy himſelf. Art thou tempted to blaſphemy? ſo was Jeſus Chriſt; for it was the moſt horrid blaſphemy that could be named, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhould fall down and worſhip a curſed Vaſſal, Satan: that he ſhonld give that honour to that curſed wretch that was due only to God: there was no ſin ſo horrid, nor heinous, nor helliſh, to which Chriſt was not tempted: he was tempted to the vileſt ſin that is, but he yielded not. Hence you may obſerve, that it is not ſin to be tempted to ſin, but it is ſin to yield to temptations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not yield to temptations. Art thou tempted either to Preſumption, or Deſperation,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45614:78"/>Atheiſm, or Blaſpemy? do not yield to that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but run to Jeſus Chriſt under that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, even as the chickens run under the Hens wing, when they ſee the Kite coming: and ſay, O Lord Jeſus, thou waſt tempted, that thou mighteft fuccour me when I am tempted. O do not lead me into temptation, but deliver me from the evil, that I do not faint under them, nor be foiled by them: <hi>Lead me not into temptation:</hi> that is, leave me not in temptations, but lead me out of them: for I flye to thee.</p>
            <p>But may be you will ſay to me, What means or helps may we uſe, that we may be ſtrengthned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt temptations, thoſe temptations wherewith Satan aſſaults us? For anſwer to this, let me briefly give theſe ſeven or eight practical Rules. which I earneſtly beg of you that you would make uſe of.</p>
            <p>The firſt practical Rule is this: Let not Satan know all that is in thy heart, for thereby Satan may get a great advantage againſt you; do not ſpeak all that thou thinkeſt: if thou be one inclined (for example) to the ſin of Pride, do not ſhew it in thy gayiſh Apparel; if thou be one inclined to the ſin of uncleanneſs, do not ſhew it in thy wanton geſtures; if thou be one inclined to covetouſneſs; do not ſhew it in thy earthly, greedy, gaping after riches; let not Satan know what is in thy heart.</p>
            <p>2dly, Do not tempt the Tempter to tempt thee; my meaning is this, be not bold with thoſe ſins for which thou haſt before ſmarted: for by foſtering any unmortified luſt, thou putteſt a weapon into Satans hand to wound thee with: be not bold with the occaſions of ſin; do not venture into the Devils quarters, as St.<hi>Peter</hi> did you know; when he went into the High-Prieſts hall, there he met with an
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45614:79"/>occaſion to ſin: he tempted Satan to tempt him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Do not think by yielding to one temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, thou ſhalt be freed from all the reſt; for if thou yield but to one temptation, Satan will be more violent in tempting thee, than he was before. I have read of a young man that was tempted to three grofs ſins: to kill his Father, to abuſe his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to be Drunk; the Devil told him, if he would yield to one of theſe, he ſhould be tempted no more; at laſt he yielded to that which was the leaſt of them, namely to be drunk: but when he had yielded to one, the Devil prevailed with him after to do the two other: ſo that he kill'd his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, abuſed his Mother; ſo that by yielding to one temptation, thou doſt ſtrengthen Satan, but it weakens thy own hands. As they ſay of the <hi>French</hi> in their fighting, at the firſt onſet they are like Lions: but if they be ſtrongly reſiſted at the firſt, then they are very Cowards: So it is here, the Devil at his firſt Aſſault is violent; the ſecond Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, if he be reſiſted, is weaker: If he be reſiſted in his third Aſſault, he is a very Coward; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>reſiſt the Devil, and he will flye from you,</hi> James 4.7. hold thy weapon in thy hand, though it be beaten to thy head. As they obſerve of the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadile in <hi>Nilus,</hi> if you run away from the Croca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile, then he will follow you; but if you come up to follow him manfully, then he will run away from you: So if Satan be reſiſted, he is a very Coward.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The fourth practical Rule is this: Do not lay all the blame upon Satan for thy temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but lay the blame in a great meaſure upon thy ſelf, upon thy own receptive tinder-like diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Oh complain to God, and ſay, true Lord, the Devil is continually ſtriking fire, but my heart is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45614:79"/>too ready to take the fire: I have a tinder-like heart, more ready to take fire, than the Devil is to ſtrike; and therefore thou ſhouldſt wet thy tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with thy tears, that the fire of temptation may not take hold of thy heart. You may read of our Grand-mother <hi>Eve,</hi> ſhe layed all the blame upon the Serpent, <hi>The Serpent deceived me, and I did eat.</hi> But <hi>David</hi> on the contrary, having a holy frame of heart, laid the blame upon himſelf: when Satan tempted him to number the People, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> laſt: he complains not of Satan, but himſelf; ſays he, <hi>Lo I have ſinned, I have ſinned, I have done wickedly; as for theſe ſheep, what have they done?</hi> So I ſay, lay the blame on thy Tinder-like heart.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Obſerve, Satan in his firſt temptations is more modeſt than he is uſually afterwards: his firſt temptations are uſually of a finer-ſpun thred, that ſo he may draw into greater ſins: for Example, When he tempted our Saviour, his firſt temptation was this: ſays he, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4, <hi>Cauſe theſe ſtones to be made bread:</hi> thou mayſt as well turn ſtones into bread, as <hi>water into wine;</hi> but then afterwards, he comes to more groſs and grievous temptations, to caſt himſelf down headlong, to murther himſelf, and commit the horrideſt Idolatry that can be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. So Satan is modeſt at the firſt: he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee to tell a merry jocond lye, to tell a lye in jeſt, that is no great matter; from a jeſting lye, he perſwades thee to tell an officious lye, for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to thy ſelf, or neighbour; from an officious lye, he will tempt thee to a pernicious lye, to tell a lye for thy neighbours ruine; for the ruine of thy neighbours Name, or Goods, or Life. Oh, obſerve the wiles of Satan, his temptations are at fiſt more modeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:45614:80"/>The ſixth Rule is this: Do not think when one temptation is conquered, or reſiſted, that therefore thy corruption is mortified: or, that the Devil is quite vanquiſned, or quite hath left thee: no, for Satan leſt our Saviour but for a ſeaſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.13, after he was ſhamefully vanquiſhed and foiled, he left him for a ſeaſon; he came to him again, as he did in <hi>John</hi> 4.30, <hi>The Prince of this world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and hath nothing in me.</hi> The Devil, like a Ram, ſometimes retires, that he may come forwards with the greater violence.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Would you be ſtrengthned againſt temptations? then above all, take the Shield of Faith, that is the Apoſtles Rule, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16, <hi>Above all take the ſhield of faith, whereby you may quench all, the fiery darts of the devil;</hi> Faith is the eye of the ſoul. Now as a cunning Fencer, when he is ſtriving with his Adverſary, the firſt thing that he aims at, is to ſtrike out the eye of him with whom he is conteſting; if he can but ſtrike out the eye, then he knows he hath a great advantage: ſo the Devil this cunning Fencer, he ſtrikes at the eye of Faith; if he can but conquer thy Fath, he knows he ſhall conquer thy ſoul; therefore, ſays he, I fight neither againſt ſmall nor great, but againſt this King-Grace; I fight againſt Faith; therefore our Savour prays that <hi>Peters</hi> Faith ſhould not fail; ſo long as his faith did not fail, though his other Graces be routed, and broken, yet Faith will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all. That was an admirable Captain, who when the Battel was loſt, recovered it again him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when all his Soldiers fled and left him; namely, <hi>Shammah,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.12, <hi>He alone ſtood to the battel, and conquered a whole Troop, and ſlew many of the Philiſtines:</hi> Faith may be compared to <hi>Shammah;</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:45614:80"/>when other Graces are foyled, and routed, our Faith will recover all again; Now how ſhould we ſtrengthen Faith? Faith is compared to a Shield; now this Shield is compoſed of four or five plates:</p>
            <p>Firſt, The gracious Promiſes that God hath made; this is one plate that makes the ſhield of Faith: you cannot be caſt into ſuch a condition, wherein you may not meet with ſome Promiſe; therefore ſtudy the Promiſes, ſuch as theſe: <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee: and through the Rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee: when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee,</hi> Iſa. 43.2. So that is an excellent Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.19, <hi>And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkneſs light before them, and crooked things ſtraight; theſe things will I do unto them, and not forſake them.</hi> What a precious Promiſe is that! though God leads his people through a dark Wilderneſs, as I may ſay, and they ſee not one beam of light; yet notwithſtanding, if they lean upon the Lord, he will cauſe darkneſs to be light before them.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Plate that the ſhield of Faith is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, and made up of, is, the glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God: Gods Wiſdom, Power, Mercy, Goodneſs, Truth; all theſe put together, do ſpell All-ſufficiency: the wiſdom of God to guide us, the power of God to protect us, the mercy of God to pity us, and the like.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another Plate is this: the triumphant victory of Jeſus Chriſt; he hath conquered our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, bleſſed be his Name; our Saviour he hath cruſht the head of the Serpent, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45614:81"/>
               <hi>Why ſhould we fear a conquered world, when the Conqueror himſelf is on our ſide?</hi> ſo, why ſhould we fear a conquered Enemy, a curſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, when the Conqueror himſelf is on our ſide?</p>
            <p>The fourth Plate is this: The former Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have had of Gods goodneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, in whom we truſt that he will yet deliver us.</hi> And when the Prophet <hi>David</hi> was in thoſe ſtraits, when he cryed out, <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? hath God forgotten to be gracious, hath he in anger ſhut up his tender mercy?</hi> Oh, ſays he, <hi>This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the moſt high.</hi> Pſal. 77.7, 8, 9, 10, <hi>I will remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Nizar;</hi> there I had a deliverance, and there I had a deliverance; and when my ſoul is caſt down within me, I will remember thee at ſuch a place, and at ſuch a place, where thou didſt work a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance for me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The laſt Plate the ſhield of Faith is made up of, is, Gods infinite love in giving of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him up for us all; how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> If God hath given us Jeſus Chriſt, he will give us ſupportation under trouble, and he will give us deliverance out of trouble.</p>
            <p>The laſt Direction is this; Give not over pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Although for the preſent thou ſeeſt not the fruit of thy prayers, give not over praying; but remember, he that was tempted for thee on earth, is now interceding for thee in heaven: Satan can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more ready to aſſault thee, than Jeſus Chriſt to aſſiſt thee; Satan cannot be ſo buſie on
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45614:81"/>earth to hurt thee, as Jeſus Chriſt is buſie in heaven to help thee; and prayer through the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt can caſt out Devils. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his book of Martyrs in the ſecond Volume, ſpeaking of <hi>Luther</hi> in the life of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, mentions a ſtory of a man that was poſſeſſed with the Devil, that had ſold his ſoul to the Devil at <hi>Wittenburg:</hi> But <hi>Luther</hi> got a company of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians together, to ſeek God on his behalf, and would not give over ſeeking, till they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Anſwer: So at laſt, the Devil in a great wind threw the Indenture in at the window. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Prayer caſts out the Devil; God ſometimes gives ſuch ſignal teſtimonies of hearing Prayer, for the enocuragement of his Servants; therefore do not give over reſiſting Satans temptations, nor praying againſt him. Do as that bleſſed Saint <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine Bretter,</hi> when ſhe was continually haunted with Satans temptations: ſaid ſhe, Satan, I am but a weak woman, I am not able to anſwer all thy cavils and objections, but I will turn thee over to my Advocate; I have an Advocate in Heaven to plead my cauſe; and after that, ſhe was never ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by him. So do you, turn over thy caſe to thy Advocate, as a poor Client does that has got a learned and faithful Advocate, leaves his cauſe with him: turn over all to thy Advocate, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the preſence of God continually for thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24, <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us:</hi> he appears as our Advocate. And if God do not anſwer thee ſpeedily, or if he do not anſwer thee in the Letter of thy requeſt, yet if thou canſt but get ſuch a frame of heart as thoſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45614:82"/>three Worthies had, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17.18, <hi>Our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery-furnace, and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O King: But if not, be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not ſerve thy gods, nor worſhip thy gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-image which thou haſt ſet up.</hi> So do thou ſay to Satan, God is able to deliver me out of thy hands; but yet, if he do not, I am reſolved I will not yield unto thee, Satan; but I will lye at the feet of God, and look up. If God do but give ſuch a gracious frame of ſpirit as this, thou mayſt be confident this Text ſhall be fulfilled to thee; and that heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, before this truth ſhall paſs away, held forth in this Doctrine, That Chriſts ſufferings and temptations ſtir up in his heart a compaſſion to ſuccour and relieve us in our ſufferings and Temptations.</p>

            <p>IN the laſt Text that I opened unto you, out of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10, <hi>And hath brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel:</hi> I ſhewed you, That the Salvation of God, or eternal Life and Salvation, was revealed to the ſons of men by the preaching of the Goſpel; and how infinitely we ſtand indebted and engaged to our God for our Goſpel-mercies and Priviledges; that we are in a capacity of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſouls ſaved; that we ſit not in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death as others do: that we are <hi>not aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael</hi> (the Church of God, as other are): that <hi>we are not ſtrangers to the Covenant of Grace,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12: and ſtrangers to the myſteries of Salvation, and the way of Salvation revealed in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Certainly, Brethren, we ſhall never know how much we are indebted unto God, nor can ever praiſe him enough for our Goſpel-mercies, until we
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45614:83"/>come to Heaven. That I aim at in the choice of this Text, is to ſhew you, and (if it be poſſible) to make you ſenſible of the infinite and unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able danger of miſſing this Salvation, this eternal Life that is held forth in the Goſpel; <hi>Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear, leſt,</hi> &amp;c. For, as I ſhall ſhew you by Gods aſſiſtance, if any of us who have the means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation tendered to us in the Goſpel, and that hope of Salvation, and the way to Salvation; if any of us ſhould come ſhort of Salvation, it were better a thouſand times that we had never known the Goſpel; for none ſhall have a deeper place in Hell, than they that have had Goſpel-opportunities, and <hi>have not known in that their day the things that belong to their peace:</hi> And certainly the tears of Hell are not ſufficient to bewail the loſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the loſs of Salvation; <hi>Let us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the connexion of this, or the coherence of theſe words with the former Chapter, take it thus briefly: If you look upon this Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> with a diſcerning eye, you ſhall ſee that the ſcope of the Apoſtle is, to lift up the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his three glorious Offices, of a King, of a Prieſt, and of a Prophet; and to ſhew his Dignity and Preheminence above the Angels, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3, above <hi>Aaron,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle proving in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3, the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt above <hi>Moſes,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Moſes</hi> was the moſt eminent man that ever lived upon the earth (there was none that ever had more acquaintance with God, talking with him familiarly, as a man talks with his friend; and therefore he was ſaid to be a King in <hi>Jeſurun);</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:45614:83"/>yet the Apoſtle proves the Dignity and Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Jeſus Chriſt above <hi>Moſes;</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.5, 6, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>And Moſes verily was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all his houſe,</hi> that is in the Church of God, <hi>as a ſervant, for a teſtimony of thoſe things which were to be ſpoken after; but Jeſus Chriſt as a Son over his own houſe;</hi> and therefore Chriſt is far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Moſes.</hi> And he takes occaſion from hence to lay down this ſerious Exhortation to theſe <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> and in them to all ſucceeding Chriſtians, that they ſhould take heed that they do not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their hearts againſt the voice of Jeſus Chriſt; in <hi>ver.</hi> 15, of the foregoing Chapter, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</hi> Harden not your hearts againſt Chriſt, againſt the voice of Chriſt in his Word; that this Exhortation might take the deeper impreſſion, the Apoſtle puts them in mind of a dreadful example of Gods wrath and indignation, executed upon the ſtubborn <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs; they hardned their hearts, they believed not his Word; and therefore God was ſo offended with them, that their carcaſſes periſh in the Wilderneſs; yea, the Lord took an Oath, he <hi>ſware that they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into his Reſt.</hi> Having laid down this dreadful example of Gods wrath, in <hi>ver.</hi> 17.18, of the foregoing Chapter; thereupon he infers this ſerious admonition, That all Chriſtians ſhould take heed that they run not into the ſame danger that they did? and that they do not deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that eternal Reſt that is laid up in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deprived themſelves of the Reſt of <hi>Canaan; Let us therefore</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his Reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45614:84"/>of it.</hi> So then in the Text you may take notice of theſe three particulars:
<list>
                  <item>1. You have a ſerious Premonition or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning, in theſe words, <hi>Let us therefore fear.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. You have the ground or foundation of this Premonition, in theſe words, <hi>Leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his Reſt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. A dreadful danger diſcovered, in caſe this warning be neglected, in theſe words, <hi>Any of you ſeem to come ſhort of it;</hi> that is, ſhort of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reſt that is promiſed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt, the ſerious Premonition or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning, you have theſe two particulars: Firſt, the occaſion of this Premonition, in this word <hi>Therefore;</hi> Now this word <hi>therefore,</hi> hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſomething that went before in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter; the Apoſtle had told us of a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners in the Wilderneſs, that had provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Lord to anger for forty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: inſomuch, that <hi>the Lord ſware that they ſhould not enter into his Reſt;</hi> and ſo it came to paſs, for of ſix hundred thouſand that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> there were but two, namely, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that entred into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> I ſay, not above two (of thoſe that were above twenty years old) that entred into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but their carcaſſes fell in the Wilderneſs, the Wilderneſs was their grave; therefore, ſaith he, becauſe of this dreadful example of Gods wrath upon theſe ſtubborn <hi>Iſraelites, Let us fear;</hi> it is as if he ſhould ſay, let their wo be our warning, their deſtruction ſhould be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: from hence you may take this point of Doctrine.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:45614:84"/>
               <l>The examples of Gods wrath upon other ſinnners,</l>
               <l>ſhould make us very careful to ſhun their ſins.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And then ſecondly, You have the Premonition it ſelf, in theſe words, <hi>Let us therefore fear;</hi> and from thence you may take this Obſervation:
<q>
                  <l>The life of a Chriſtian muſt be a life of fear;</l>
                  <l>The whole courſe of a Chriſtians life, muſt be a courſe of godly and watchful fear.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And then you have the ground or foundation of this Premonition, in theſe words, <hi>Leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his Reſt;</hi> wherein you have three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is a heavenly Reſt, an eternal Reſt prepared; this the Apoſtle takes for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He ſpeaks here of entring into this Reſt; therefore there is a Reſt prepared; from whence you may take this Obſervation:
<q>That there is a Reſt prepared in Heaven for Gods people.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This Reſt is not only prepared, but it is alſo promiſed. Obſerve here, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his Reſt;</hi> from hence you may obſerve,
<q>That the Reſt prepared in Heaven for Gods People, is not only prepared, but alſo promiſed to all them that do believe.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Take notice, This Reſt, though it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and promiſed, may yet be left and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

            <q>Though God be infinitely gracious in making a promiſe of eternal Reſt: yet many there are that do ſhamefully forſake this Promiſe.</q>
            <p>The third and laſt branch of the Text, is the dreadful danger diſcovered, in caſe this Premoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be neglected, that is in theſe words, <hi>Leſt any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it;</hi> you have three particulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Perſons that muſt avoid this dreadful danger, in theſe words, <hi>Any of you;</hi> It is very obſervable here, how jealous the Apoſtle is of theſe <hi>Hebrews,</hi> leſt any of them ſhould prove A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates and Backſliders, and fall off from their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45614:85"/>profeſſion and principles, and ſo forſake the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and by forſaking the Promiſe, ſhould come ſhort of eternal Reſt; from whence you may take this Obſervation, or point of Doctrine:
<q>In matters of ſoul-concernment, Chriſtians ſhould be very jealous, not only of themſelves, but of others alſo.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Obſerve the manner or extent of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding this dreadful danger, in this phraſe, <hi>ſeem,</hi> leſt any <hi>ſeem to come ſhort of it;</hi> it is as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, It is not enough for you to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Apoſtacy and Back-ſliding, which will cauſe your coming ſhort of Heaven, but you muſt avoid the very ſeeming and appearance of it; it is not enough that you do not utterly fall away, but you muſt likewiſe take heed that you give no occaſion to others to think that you are fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or like to fall away; from whence you may obſerve this Doctrine:
<q>That it is not enough for Chriſtians to abſtain from evil, but they muſt alſo abſtain from the appearance of evil, and avoid the occaſions of danger.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But I come to the third and laſt particular, in the laſt branch of the Text, which is indeed the moſt awakening and ſoul-ſhaking truth that you meet with in the whole Book of God; that is, the unconceivable damage, or unvaluable loſs, that will fall upon them that do neglect the Apoſtles Premonition here, that is, that the ſhall come ſhort of eternal life: <hi>leſt any of you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45614:86"/>ſeem to come ſhort of it;</hi> or leſt any of you ſhould be deprived of that eternal Reſt that is prepared for, and promiſed to all thoſe that do believe; ſo then, in this laſt particular, in the laſt branch of the Text, there is ſomething implyed, and ſomething expreſſed: that which is implyed, is this, That it is poſſible for thoſe that do profeſs the truth, to come ſhort of heaven, or elſe the Apoſtle would not have ſet down this Premonition here: and then that which is expreſt, is this, That it is a moſt unvaluable and unconceivable loſs, to come ſhort of Heaven; ſo then from hence, there are theſe two points of Doctrine I ſhall commend to you; and truly, they are two very ſtartling and awakening Truths, as by Gods aſſiſtance you ſhall hear in the proſecution of them; And the firſt Doctrine is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 1.</hi> That it is poſſible for many that profeſs the truth, and are confident that they are in a ſtate of grace, and ſeem to come very near to Heaven; yet for all that to come ſhort of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 2.</hi> To come ſhort of Heaven, or that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs which is prepared for the Saints in light, is a moſt dreadful, unconceivable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable, irrecoverable loſs; a loſs that ſhould be trembled at by all ſorts of perſons whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt Doctrine, That it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for many that do profeſs the truth, or true Religion, and are confident that they do belong to God, and are in a ſtate of Grace, and do ſeem to come very near to Heaven, yet for all that to come ſhort of Heaven. This is a very awakening Truth;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45614:86"/>but I ſhall by Gods aſſiſtance make it clear to you, and confirm it in the three Branches of it:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, That it is poſſible for many Profeſſors of the Truth, or true Religion, to come ſhort of Heaven.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, That it is poſſible for many that are confident that they are in a ſtate of Grace, to come ſhort of Heaven.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, That it is poſſible for many that come very near to Heaven, yet to come ſhort of Heaven.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall prove theſe three, and let your hearts go along with me; and oh, that you and I could follow the counſel of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, To hear the word of the Lord with trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, That it is poſſible for many that profeſs the Truth and true Religion, to come ſhort of Heaven: I ſhall give you two inſtances for this: the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were thoſe that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the truth and true Religon, they ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair; our Saviour commanded his Diſciples to hear them, becauſe they opened the Law, they were Expounders of the Law: and our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Diſciples to hear them, although they ſhould not do as they did: they profeſſed the Truth and true Religion; and in the outward acts of Piety, theſe <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> went exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far. I will ſhew you how far they went, in theſe ſix particulars:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, They ſearched the Scriptures: they were very diligent in reading the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> they gave themſelves ſo much to the ſtudy of the Law, that they could tell exactly almoſt every verſe in the five books of <hi>Moſes:</hi> nay, they could tell you how often every letter in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Alphabet was repeated in the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> for example,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45614:87"/>the Letter <hi>Aleph</hi> was repeated Three-hundred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty-ſeven times in the five books of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, They were frequent in prayer; they prayed in the Streets, and in the Synagogue, and made long prayers for a pretence to devour Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows houſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.14.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, To Prayer, they added Faſting alſo: hear what one of them ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12, <hi>I faſt twice in the week:</hi> and this he did for the taming of the body.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, They were very ſtrict in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath, inſomuch that they quarrelled with our Saviour becauſe his Diſciples did but pluck the ears of Corn upon the Sabbath day; nay, they were ſo ſuperſtitious in the obſervation of the Sabbath, that if one had got a thorn in his foot, they would not pull it out upon the Sabbath-day, for fear of breaking the Sabbath.</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, They were very induſtrious in teaching of others: <hi>they compaſſed Sea and Land to make a Proſelyte,</hi> Matth. 23.15: they would have taken any pains to win others to the ſame Sect or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with themſelves.</item>
                  <item>Sixthly, They were very exact and unblameable in their outward converſation; for,</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They were free from more groſs and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſins which ſtare a man in the face: <hi>God, I thank thee</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Phariſee</hi>) <hi>that I am not as other men are: extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this Publican,</hi> Luke 18.11: Nay, they ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves from notorious ſinners; they would not come into the company of Drunkards and Sabbath-breakers: they were of the ſtricteſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion amongſt the Jews: their Religion was the moſt ſtrait Sect, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.5, <hi>which knew me from
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45614:87"/>the beginning, if they would teſtifie, that after the moſt ſtrait Sect of our Religion, I lived a Phariſee;</hi> inſomuch that it was generally conceived among the Jews, that if there were but two men in all the world that ſhould go to Heaven, a <hi>Scribe</hi> was one, and a <hi>Phariſee</hi> the other; and yet thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors for all that, fell ſhort of Heaven; and our Saviour ſaith, <hi>That except your righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, you ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Matth. 5.20.</p>
            <p>Let me give you another example of the five fooliſh Virgins which you read of in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25: Our Saviour tells us, That five Virgins were wiſe, and five were fooliſh; By Virgins there, are meant Profeſſors, and they are called <hi>Virgin-Profeſſors,</hi> becauſe they were not tainted or defiled with any groſs or ſcandalous ſin; even thoſe five fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, they notwithſtanding in their own opinion, and in the opinion of others, were waiting for the coming of the Bridegroom Chriſt; and yet for all this, thoſe Virgin-profeſſors fell ſhort of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.10, <hi>And while they went to buy, the Bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the Marriage, and the door was ſhut;</hi> the door of Heaven, the door of Mercy was ſhut againſt them; ſo you ſee the firſt Branch proved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let me prove the ſecond Branch, That it is poſſible for many that are confident that they are in a ſtate of Grace, and that they have an intereſt in, and belong to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to come ſhort of Heaven; in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23, <hi>Many will ſay to me in that day,</hi> (at the great day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name; and in thy name have caſt out Devils, and in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45614:88"/>thy name have done many wonderful works? and then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye that work iniquity.</hi> Mark, how confident they are; <hi>have we not propheſied in thy name, and caſt out Devils in thy name? We have eaten and drunk in thy preſence,</hi> Luke 13.26: To whom Jeſus Chriſt will ſay, <hi>Depart from me ye that work iniquity: get you out of my ſight, I cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to look upon you;</hi> theſe were confident, What a deal of confidence expreſs they! as if they had been as really acquainted with Jeſus Chriſt, as any were; <hi>Lord, Lord, have not we propheſied in thy name,</hi> &amp;c? Again, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, 18, 19, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks there to that boaſting Jew, <hi>Thou reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Law, and makeſt thy boaſt of God, and knoweſt his will, and approveſt the things that are more excellent, being inſtructed out of the Law, and art confident that thou thy ſelf art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkneſs; an inſtructor of the fooliſh, a teacher of babes: which haſt the form of knowledg, and of the truth in the Law; thou therefore which teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf?</hi> Such a one as teacheth others, and teacheth not himſelf, ſuch a one is ſtark naught; ſo that it is poſſible for a man to be a teacher of others, and confident of coming to Heaven, and yet for all that come ſhort of it; that's the ſecond Branch.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let me prove the third branch of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, That it is poſſible for men to come very near to Heaven, and yet for all that to come ſhort of Heaven. Let me give you ſome Examples for that: This was the caſe of the young man in the Goſpel, which you read of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19 20, 21, when our Saviour bid him to keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45614:88"/>ſaith he, <hi>Lord, all theſe things I have kept from my youth up;</hi> the meaning is this, as to his outward converſation he was unblameable: he came ſo near Heaven, that as St. <hi>Mark</hi> relates the ſtory, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21, <hi>Jeſus beholding him, loved him;</hi> that is, he looked upon him in a very friendly manner, and pitied him, that ſuch a one ſhould come ſo near to Heaven, and yet come ſhort of it, by reſting on his own ſelf-righteouſneſs; he came near Heaven, but yet he came ſhort of it: ſo <hi>Herod</hi> came near Heaven, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.20, <hi>he heard John Baptiſt gladly,</hi> and he did many things that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> bid him, and yet he came ſhort of it. So you read of a <hi>Scribe,</hi> Mar. 12.34, that anſwered very diſcreetly to our Saviour; our Saviour tells him, <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> and yet he came ſhort of it; What a ſad thing was that! So <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, Almoſt thou perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian,</hi> Act. 26.28; but yet he was not a whole Chriſtian; ſo he came near to Heaven, but yet he came ſhort of Heaven. But here it may be demanded:</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how far then may a man go on in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the truth and true Religion, and yet come ſhort of Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, Truly a Profeſſor may go ſo far, that the hearing of it may make ſome of you tremble, and to ſay, What will become of me! Now I ſhall ſhew you that in three particulars:
<list>
                  <head>A man may have,</head>
                  <item>1. A very glorious ſhew of grace and holineſs, and yet have no true grace at all.</item>
                  <item>2. Admirable gifts, and parts, and qualifications, and yet have no true grace at all.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:45614:89"/>3. Some ſuperficial beginnings, and taſts of Grace and Holineſs, and yet have no truth of Grace, but come ſhort of Heaven.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, A man may have a very glorious ſhew of holineſs, and yet have no true grace, and ſo come ſhort of Heaven; he may have ſomething like grace; as in a Garden, Weeds may be ſo like good Herbs, that it may be hard to know one from the other: a man may have ſuch a ſhew of grace, that he may be thought to have grace in truth: Let me give you inſtances in theſe four particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, A man may be a fair civil carriaged man, very innocent and inoffenſive in his converſation: one that doth not oppoſe the Goſpel, nor oppoſe the Truth; this is ſomething. Some there are that are Lions, of whom <hi>David</hi> complains, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 57.4, <hi>My ſoul is among Lions, and I lye even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that are ſet on fire.</hi> Some there are that have Lion-like Spirits, whoſe hearts are all ſet on fire: that would overthrow Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and Sabbaths, and Ordinances, and all; it is ſomething for a man to be civil and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in his carriage, that he is no Enemy to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A man may be a frequenter of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: and a man may be a countenancer of Religion, and an owner of Magiſtracy and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and yet all this while have but a ſhew of grace, and no true grace at all. In <hi>Luke</hi> 13.26, 27, there you have ſome that will ſay to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Lord, we have eaten and drunk in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and we have heard thee teach in our ſtreets.</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:45614:89"/>There are many that frequent Ordinances, that come to the Aſſemblies of Gods people day after day, and wait upon God in the uſe of his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: ſome that honour the Miniſters of God, and yet for all that come ſhort of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They may go farther; they may be maintainers and ſupporter of Miniſters, both by their Perſons and Purſes: and thus it was with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira: they went and ſold their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and laid them down at the Apoſtles feet,</hi> and yet come ſhort of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They may go ſo far, not only to have a good opinion of themſelves, but they may gain the good opinion of others: Nay, they may be well thought of by thoſe that are men of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; thoſe that are godly may think well of them, that they are real Saints, and that their names are written in the book of life, as is meant by that Scripture, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69.28, where <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous;</hi> It cannot ſo be underſtood, that a man that hath once his name written in the book of Life, can have it blotted out: but the meaning is this, Blot them out of the book of Life, that is, diſcover their names were never written in that book; diſcover them to be but Hypocrites, though they carry themſelves ſo fairly, that for the preſent others do think that their names are written in the book of Life; <hi>Judas</hi> carried the matter ſo fair, that the reſt of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples queſtioned themſelves, rather than <hi>Judas: Maſter, is it I?</hi> ſaith one of them; <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> ſaith another; they never dreamed that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> ſhould betray their Maſter. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> carried the matter ſo fair, that <hi>Philip,</hi> that was one
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45614:90"/>of the Deacons, reckoned him to be a true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and was baptized, and continued with <hi>Philip.</hi> This is the firſt particular, That a man may have glorious ſhews of grace and holineſs, and yet have no true grace at all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond thing is to ſhew, that a man may have admirable gifts and parts, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications that are like to grace, and yet are not true grace. For example:</p>
            <p>A man may have an admirable gift in Preaching; he may be a very able Preacher, having a very acute and quick Invention: a profound Judgment, a retentive Memory, a clear Elocution: <hi>Judas,</hi> I make no queſtion, was as good a Preacher as the reſt of the eleven Apoſtles; a man may preach to others, and yet he himſelf in the mean while be a caſt-away; Oh we that are Preachers, we may preach againſt Pride with proud hearts: againſt Covetouſneſs with covetous hearts: preſs Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial with ſelf-ſeeking hearts: preſs Repentance with impenitent hearts: we may preach theſe things, and yet not feel them at all in our own hearts: So, a man may have an admirable gift in Prayer (I do not ſay the grace of Prayer), there is a great deal of difference between the gift and the grace of Prayer; the gift of Prayer makes a man proud, the grace of Prayer makes a man humble: the gift of Prayer abounds in outward expreſſions, the grace of Prayer conſiſts in inward impreſſions upon the heart; the gift of Prayer vents its ſelf in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but the grace of Prayer is moſt enlarged in private; the gift of Prayer makes a man pray in his own ſtrength, but the grace of Prayer makes a man pray in the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt; the gift of Prayer makes a man expect an eccho of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45614:90"/>praiſe from men, but the grace of Prayer expects only the approbation of God; the gift of prayer that may be loſt, but the grace of Prayer is never loſt; I ſay, a man may have admirable gifts in Prayer, excellent Expreſſions, and ſeeming-impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the heart: ſome may pray like Saints, and in the mean time live like Devils. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident this deceives many: Some there are that have fine voluble Tongues in Prayer, that a man would think them to be Angels in prayer: but look into their lives, and O how crooked are they in their paths and converſation?</p>
            <p>So, A man may have the gift of Government, ſo much prudence and policy: a man may be ſuch a deep Polititian, that he may be able to ballance the affairs of a Kingdom, and yet have no grace at all; that was the caſe of <hi>Achitophel:</hi> he was ſo prudent and politick in his counſels, that he was eſteemed as an Oracle of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.23. And yet for all this, ſuch a one may come ſhort of Heaven; and that may be ſaid to thoſe men that have thoſe parts, and gifts, and qualifications, and are not ſanctified; that have the gifts of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and praying, and Government, which was ſaid to <hi>Simon Magus, Thy money periſh with thee;</hi> ſo they and their gifts, and parts, and qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons periſh with them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Again, you ſhall ſee in another parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, how far Profeſſors may go, and yet come ſhort of Heaven; namely, he may have ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial beginnings and taſts of grace and holineſs, and yet have no truth of grace, and ſo come ſhort of Heaven; let me ſhew you this in theſe four particulars:</p>
            <p>1. He may be able to give his aſſent to the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45614:91"/>truth; he may conſent to this truth, That the Bible is the word of God, and that he believes it is ſo; ſo <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13, the Text ſaith, that he believed.</p>
            <p>2. He may have ſo much knowledg as may move his affections with joy, that he may rejoyce in the word that he knows: thus the <hi>Phariſees, They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in John Baptiſts light for a ſeaſon,</hi> John 5.35. And it is ſaid of the ſecond ground in the Parable, that they received the word with joy, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. And God ſpeaks of the Hypocrites, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2, <hi>Yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a Nation that did rigteouſneſs, and forſook not the Ordinance of their God: they ask of me the Ordinances of Juſtice, they take delight in approaching to God;</hi> and yet all this, it was but like a Land-flood that is quickly dryed up: or like a flaſh of lightning which quickly paſſeth away.</p>
            <p>3. He may have ſuch a taſt and ſuperficial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of grace, that he may be moved ſo much at a Sermon, as to have ſome kind of purpoſe and reſolution of amendment of life, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.21, you may read there that wicked wretch and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite <hi>Saul</hi> had ſometimes good purpoſes and reſolutions: Then ſaid <hi>Saul, I have ſinned; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn my ſon</hi> David, <hi>for I will no more do the harm;</hi> he was convinced in his conſcience, that it was out of malice that he did perſecute that innocent Servant of God; ſo it may be you may have ſome Drunkard, when he lyes under the ſmarting Rod of Gods diſpleaſure, to vow that he will never be drunk more.</p>
            <p>4. A man may have this taſt and ſuperficial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of grace, that he may attain to ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal reformation; <hi>he may eſcape the pollutions of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45614:91"/>the world through the knowledg of the Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20. A natural carnal man, an Hypocrite, may get ſo much ſoap out of the Word of God, as may waſh his outſide, but yet he may return to the mire again, becauſe he is a Swine ſtill: he may be waſhed like a Hog on the outſide, but yet he is a Swine ſtill: Hypocrites may abſtain from many ſins out of a ſlaviſh fear, and perform duties out of by-reſpects; <hi>Jezzabel</hi> faſted, the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> prayed, and gave alms; <hi>Felix</hi> feared and trembled, here was the beginnings and taſts of grace; theſe taſted of the heavenly gift: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4; they had a taſt of the water of life, but they ſpit it out again.</p>
            <p>But then it may be demanded, <hi>What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that a Profeſſor may go ſo far in the ways of Chriſtianity, and yet come ſhort of Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer, I ſhall give you reaſons for all theſe three particulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, A Profeſſor may go thus far in the way to Heaven, and yet come ſhort of Heaven, for theſe two reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is ſome failing in his profeſſion; his profeſſion wants either root or ſincerity, or love to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It may be his profeſſion wants root: he hath taken up the profeſſion of Religion, but he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet humbled; the Plow of humiliation never went deep enough: he was never convinced of the indiſpenſible need that he hath of Chriſt, to ſay, <hi>Give me Chriſt, or I dye;</hi> he was never convinced of the evil of ſin, of the burden of ſin, of the loathſome nature of ſin, of the Hell that is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſin.</p>
            <p>Or it may be he wants Sincerity, he takes up
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45614:92"/>Religion for by-ends, or for ſelf-intereſt, or it may be he follows Chriſt for the Loaves: for indeed there are but few that follow Chriſt for Chriſts ſake. It was the complaint of <hi>Auſtin, Jeſus is ſeldom ſought for Jeſus ſake.</hi> And as God complains, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.5, <hi>When ye faſted and mourned, did ye at all faſt unto me, even unto me? Ephraim is an empty Vine, bringing forth fruit unto himſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 10.1.</p>
            <p>Or it may be, his profeſſion wants love; now love is an inward principle; and where the inward principle of love is in the heart, there profeſſion never fails, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.24, <hi>Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity.</hi> But now, it may be outwardly he hath ſome love to Jeſus Chriſt, as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of his Hearers, or God to him concerning them: <hi>Son of Man, the children of thy people come unto thee as the people cometh, and they ſit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but will not do them: for with their mouths they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs,</hi> Ezek. 33.30, 31. And the Lord Chriſt may ſay to them, juſt as <hi>Dalilah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Sampſon, How canſt thou ſay thou loveſt me, when thy heart is not with me?</hi> Judg. 16.15. That is one Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond is this: Men may go ſo far in the way to Heaven, and yet come ſhort of it; becauſe though they have an outward lamp of profeſſion, yet they have no oyl in their lamps: that is, no reality; they have not that faith that works by love: they have not that repentance which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them more mortification, which crucifieth the fleſh; theſe are the Reaſons of the firſt Branch.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It may be demanded, How comes it to paſs, that men may be ſo confident that they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45614:92"/>are in a ſtate of grace, and yet come ſhort of Heaven?</p>
            <p>The reaſon is this, becauſe of their own ſelf-flattery, and ſelf-deluſion: <hi>They think themſelves ſomething when they are nothing, and ſo deceive themſelves: they think themſelves rich, and increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in goods, and ſtand in need of nothing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> They think they have grace, when indeed they have none; they think their Grace is true, when it is but counterfeit; they think their faith is true Faith, when it is but Fancy; they think their Repentance is true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, when it is but Worldly-ſorrow; they think their obedience is true Obedience, when it is but Hypocriſie. It may be they take Civility for Sanctity, and natural parts for true Piety: it may be they take Reſtraining-grace for Renewing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and ſo they are deceived in their ſpiritual Eſtates. Thouſands there are that deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this particular.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It may be demanded: But how comes it to paſs that it is poſſible for men to come near to Heaven, and yet come ſhort of Heaven?</p>
            <p>For anſwer to this, I ſhall give you but two Reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Men come near Heaven, and yet come ſhort of Heaven, becauſe they will not come up to the price; I do not mean the price of merit; I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor that opinion, to think that we can merit Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but my meaning is this, they do not come up to the price of means: though nothing can be done by way of merit, yet much muſt be done in the uſe of means: my meaning is, they will not do that which Jeſus Chriſt would have them do:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45614:93"/>they will not ſuffer that which muſt be ſuffered; they will not forſake that which muſt be forſaken.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. They will not do that which Jeſus Chriſt would have them do; for Example, they will not walk exactly, they will not renew their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; they will not ſet about the work of God with all their might, and mind, and ſtrength; they will not work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling; there is much to be done, many du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be done from a right principle, in a right manner, and to a right end.</item>
               <item>2. They will not ſuffer that which is to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, take up his croſs and follow me:</hi> You muſt be content to bear his Croſs, as well as to wear his Crown; Now this they will not do.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Again, They will not forſake that which muſt be forſaken; our Saviour ſaith, a man muſt part with his right-eye, and right-hand, any thing that ſtands in oppoſition to, or that comes in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with him. Now men will not do, they will not ſuffer, they will not forſake what Chriſt would have them: It fares with them as with a pedling Chapman, who likes a Commodity well, but he will not come up to the price of it; men are willing to do ſomething, but they will not do ſo much as is required: they will not proportion their labour according to their work, they will not make up the hedg according to the breach. This is certain, many there are that come ſhort of Heaven, becauſe they do not uſe the utmoſt of their endeavours, for the proſecution of the end; many come ſhort of Heaven, becauſe of their ſlight endeavours in the way of heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 13,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45614:93"/>
               <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able;</hi> What is the reaſon? they only ſeek, but do not ſtrive; It is not enough for you to ſeek to enter in at the ſtrait gate, unleſs you ſtrive, and you muſt ſtrive as in an Agony; ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſignifies the Original.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A ſecond reaſon is this, Why ſome men come ſo near Heaven, and yet come ſhort of Heaven, Becauſe of their Apoſtacy: they <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the ſpirit, and end in the fleſh: they put their hands to the Plow, and look back; you did run well, who did hinder you, that ye ſhould not obey the truth?</hi> Gal. 5.7. You do not obey it conſtantly, you are not ſteady and firm in the truth, but you are ſtarting aſide like a broken bow; falling from the truth in their profeſſion, and in their practice of Religion: Theſe are the reaſons why men come near Heaven, and yet come ſhort of Heaven. And thus I have proved the Point in the three Branches of it. Now what uſe ſhall we make of it?</p>
            <p>The Uſe is this, by way of Conviction; Oh what terrour may this ſtrike into the hearts of all thoſe who are only Nominal Chriſtians, that have a name only to live, and in the mean time are dead; that have a form of Godlineſs, but are as great ſtrangers to the power of it, as Pagans are to the profeſſion of it! Oh what terrour may this ſtrike into the hearts of all you that come ſhort of thoſe that come ſhort of Heaven! and if you come ſhort of thoſe that come ſhort of heaven, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you? For example, May a man be a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter of the Word of God? May a man make conſcience of keeping the Sabbath? I mean, for the external obſervation of it: May a man be a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45614:94"/>countenancer of Religion, and yet come ſhort of Heaven? then what will become of them that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Ordinances? What will become of them to whom the Word of the Lord is a burden? <hi>The word of the Lord is unto them a reproach, they have no delight in it,</hi> Jer. 16.10. And what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them that ſay of the ſervice of the Lord, <hi>What a wearineſs is it?</hi> Mal. 1.13. What a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs is it to wait on God, and to hear Sermons? If a man may be a Believer, and yet come ſhort of Heaven, I mean, a temporary Believer, to believe for a while; then what will become of them that believe not at all? believe none of the Precepts of God to obey them? nor the promiſes, to embrace them, nor the threatnings to tremble at them; If a man have outward reformation, and yet come ſhort of Heaven; What then will become of them that have no reformation at all, that wallow in the mire of their ſins? What will become of Lyars, and Swearers, and Drunkards. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were no friends to thoſe groſs ſins, and yet they came ſhort of Heaven. Oh that this might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken all thoſe that are yet aſleep in their ſins, that are rockt in the Devils Cradle, and that do not underſtand their own condition! May a man have natural parts and qualifications, and yet come ſhort of Heaven? What will become of them that are Sots in matters of Religion, that have not obtained to their <hi>A B C</hi> in Religion, but are ignorant of the fundamentals of Religion? May a man have ſome ſuperficial taſts and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of grace, and give his aſſent to the truths of the Goſpel? May he receive the word of God with joy? May he be moved at a Sermon, and have a reſolution to obey, and reform many
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45614:94"/>things, and yet come ſhort of Heaven? then how doleful and dreadful is their condition, that have no affection to, nor no delight in the Word of the Lord? that have no purpoſes of new and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obedience; but they come to hear the Word out of Formality and Cuſtom, and not to get any ſpiritual advantage to their own ſouls: Oh! if this were ſeriouſly thought upon, it would make Sinners to look about them, and to fall down at the feet of God, and ſay, <hi>Lord, what will become of me! Lord, what will become of me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Of Exhortation. I ſhall cloſe this Point with a word of Exhortation. If it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for many that profeſs the Truth and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and are confident that they are in a ſtate of grace, and ſeem to come very near to Heaven, and yet for all that to come ſhort of it; then as you love your God, as you love your Souls, as you love your Peace, as you deſire to appear with comfort before your Judg, reſt not in any bare outward profeſſion; reſt not in a naked name of Religion: Be not contented that you have the Lamps of Profeſſion, unleſs you have the Oyl of ſaving Grace. Conſider, what advantage will it be for you to come near to heaven, to come to the brow of the hill, as it were, and afterwards to drop down into hell! What advantage will it be for a man to be lifted up to heaven, and not lifted up into heaven! it is the greateſt curſe that can poſſibly be expreſſed. Oh what a cutting Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive, what a gnawing Worm will this be to all Eternity, for a man to ſay, <hi>I came near to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to the top of the Hill, and yet I fell ſhort of thoſe glorious hopes that are laid up for the Saints in light:</hi> O what a ſtinking Cockatrice will this be
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45614:95"/>to them that have but a bare naked name of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, an outward profeſſion only.</p>
            <p>It may be thou art no Swearer, nor Lyar, nor Sabbath-breaker, but it may be thou art a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous wretch, over head and ears in the world, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling up and down in dirt and clay, as if there were no other happineſs but here below: It may be thou art but a formal Chriſtian; it may be thou art but a picture that hath hands and eyes, but no legs: it may be thou haſt eyes, but no feet to run the ways of Gods Commandments: It may be, it may be ſaid of ſome of you young men that hear me this day, what was ſaid of the young man in the Goſpel, <hi>You are not far from the Kingdom of God;</hi> what will this advantage you, if you do not follow Jeſus Chriſt fully, and obey him ſincerely, that you may enjoy him eternally! O that my counſel this day were accepted by you; in the fear of the Lord give no reſt to your eyes, nor ſlumber to your eye-lids, until you can ſay, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, I am more than the beſt Hypocrite in the world; though he can outſtrip me in ſhew, yet for the inſide I outſtrip him. But it may be you will ſay, What is this inſide of Chriſtianity, this eſſential Religion, wherein you would have us outſtrip Hypocrites, and thoſe that come ſhort of Heaven?</p>
            <p>I will tell you in three words: To the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, there are theſe three things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired:
<list>
                  <item>1. Union with Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>2. Renewing Grace.</item>
                  <item>3. A Compliance with the Will of Chriſt.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Union with Chriſt: Till you are united to him, you have no intereſt in him, nor benefit
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45614:95"/>by him; therefore look this, that you have the Spirit of God to unite you to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 15.4, <hi>As the branch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the Vine, ſo neither can you bring forth fruit, unleſs you abide in me.</hi> O labour for this Union: when the Soul is once united to him, then it hath communion with him, in his life, in his death, in his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in his interceſſion, in his graces, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and all. What is that which knits the Ciſtern to the Fountain? You know it is the Leaden Pipe, that is it that is the conveyance from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit-head to the Ciſtern: ſo here; What is it that knits thy Soul to Jeſus Chriſt, that thou mayſt be continually partaking of him, who is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of light, and life, and peace, and conſolation? What is it but this Pipe, the Union that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the ſoul? Now a Hypocrite hath not this Union, he is not united to Chriſt: it may be he bears the name of Chriſt, but never was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into him: it may be he is tyed to Chriſt by the thred of an outward profeſſion, as the <hi>Seions</hi> is tied to the ſtock, but yet he is not ingrafted into the ſtock.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It conſiſts in renewing Grace: <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. An Hypocrite may have many trinkets and bables, as we ſay; I, but a Regenerate man, he brings forth one Jewel worth ten thouſand of them: An Hypocrite may have reſtraining grace; but a truly Regenerate man, he is renewed in the ſpirit of his mind: he hath a new name, which I ſpake of in ſo many Sermons, the white Stone, and the new Name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Eſſence of Chriſtianity, conſiſts
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45614:96"/>in a total compliance with the Will of Chriſt; he that is a true Believer, a true Regenerate man, an inſide Chriſtian, he can ſay, <hi>Lord, not my will, but thy will be done;</hi> Lord, Rule in me as thou pleaſeſt, ſo I may be but thine; take poſſeſſion of my heart, and diſpoſſeſs ſin and Satan: he will ſay, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now an Hypocrite, it may be he gives up his name to Jeſus Chriſt in profeſſion, but he doth not give up his heart to Chriſt in ſubjection and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: it is one thing to give up the name to Chriſt, and another thing to give up the heart to Chriſt; when you give up the key of the Caſtle to Chriſt, then you will ſay, <hi>Lord, I will do what thou wouldſt have me do, and ſuffer what thou wouldſt have me ſuffer, and forſake what thou wouldſt have me forſake, there is nothing I have, though it be as dear to me as my right-hand, and right-eye, but I will part with it at thy command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſhut up all, If you would not come ſhort of them that come ſhort of Heaven, then reſt not in a bare profeſſion, in a bare naked name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; labour to be united to Chriſt, labour for renewing Grace: labour to give up your ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt; let there be a compliance in your will to the will of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Again, If many may be confident that they are in a ſtate of Grace, and yet come ſhort of Heaven; O then take heed of ſelf-deluſion, and ſelf-flattery, to think your ſelves ſomething when you are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſo deceive your own ſouls: It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a thouſand times for a man to think himſelf nothing when he is ſomething, than to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſomething when he is nothing; ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45614:96"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10, <hi>I have laboured more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly than they all, and yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> Beg earneſtly of God that you may know the worſt of your ſelves, and the beſt of Jeſus Chriſt; and pray, <hi>O Lord, let me not be deceived in this great buſineſs of Eternity; let me not go to hell with vain hopes of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, May a man come near to Heaven, and yet come ſhort of it? O then take heed of theſe two ſins, Slothfulneſs and Apoſtacy.</p>
            <p>Take heed of Slothfulneſs: <hi>Be not ſlothful in buſineſs, but fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the violent take it by force,</hi> Matth. 11.12. <hi>Give all diligence to make your calling and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure;</hi> ſet to the work with all your might, put your whole ſtrength to the work: ſhake off all drowſineſs and dulneſs.</p>
            <p>And then take heed of Apotacy: this makes many that come near to Heaven, to come ſhort of Heaven, becauſe they do not hold out to the end: <hi>He that endures to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhall be ſaved;</hi> bleſſed are they who notwithſtanding all difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements that they meet with in Heavens way, are reſolved to hold out to the end, and in the end. Thus I have diſpatcht the firſt Doctrine, That it is poſſible for many that profeſs the Truth, and are confident that they are in a State of Grace, and ſeem to come near to Heaven, and yet for all that to come ſhort of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the ſecond Doctrine in this laſt Branch of my Text, from theſe words; <hi>Come ſhort of it.</hi> And the Doctrine is this:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:45614:97"/>
               <q>To come ſhort of eternal Reſt, is ſuch an unvalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unconceivable, and irrecover able loſs, that it is to be trembled at, by all ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is a loſs to be trembled at by all thoſe that have not quite loſt their ſenſe and feeling. For the confirmation of this truth, there are theſe two Queries I ſhall ſpeak to:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, <hi>What it is to come ſhort of this eternal Reſt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, <hi>How it may appear that this coming ſhort of Heaven, is ſuch an unvaluable, irrecoverable, and unconceivable loſs.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>What it is to come ſhort of this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reſt;</hi> What is it? Oh! God grant that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you, nor I, nor any ſoul here preſent, may ever experimentally know what it is to come ſhort of Gods eternal reſt; let me ſhew you what it is, that you may avoid this dreadful danger; The Original word here uſed, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to come too late, juſt as thoſe five fooliſh Virgins that had no oyl in their Lamps, they came and knockt, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>open to us:</hi> but the door of Mercy was ſhut, they came too late; <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.10, 11. It ſignifies likewiſe to fail of that which a man expects, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15, <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligently, leſt any man fail of the grace of God.</hi> Or it ſignifies this, for a man to miſs the Gole or Prize that he runs for, and ſo it is a Metaphor from runners in a Race: if they be heavy, or lumpiſh, or careleſs, they loſe the Prize, they miſs the Gole; So Chriſtians that are ſecure. and careleſs, and ſlothful, and mind every thing more than that one thing that is neceſſary; they come too late, they
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:45614:97"/>fail of Grace and Glory, they miſs the Gole, they loſe the Prize, they are deprived of that eternal happineſs they expected: this is to come ſhort of this eternal Reſt.</p>
            <p>Second, It may be demanded, <hi>How will it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that this coming ſhort of eternal Reſt, is ſuch an unvaluable, unconceivable, and irrevocable loſs, that it is to be trembled at?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, It will appear by theſe three reaſons:
<list>
                  <item>They that come ſhort of Heaven, they loſe, 1. The Preſence Of God in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</item>
                  <item>They that come ſhort of Heaven, they loſe, 2. The Favour Of God in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</item>
                  <item>They that come ſhort of Heaven, they loſe, 3. The Fruition Of God in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, They that come ſhort of this Eternal Reſt, they loſe the preſence of God; how great, how unconceivably great this loſs is, it paſſeth my skill to tell you: But conceive it thus: <hi>David</hi> tells us, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. <hi>ult. In his preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at his right hand are pleaſures for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore.</hi> Now, if in the preſence of God be the fulneſs of joy, then certainly in the want of his preſence, is the fulneſs of miſery? <hi>If at his right hand are pleaſures for evermore, then certainly at his left hand is wo, and miſery, and calamity for evermore:</hi> even ſuch miſery as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. <hi>ult. A roll of a book was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten within and without, lamentations, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wo:</hi> And it ſtands with reaſon it ſhould be ſo; for, if God be light, then a ſeparation from God muſt needs be darkneſs; If God be life, then a ſeparation from God muſt needs be death; If God be the fountain of Bliſs, then the ſeparation
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45614:98"/>from him muſt needs be the poſſeſſion of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and wo, and calamity, and diſtreſs, that can poſſibly be expreſſed or conceived. This puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of loſs, in the opinion of all Divines, doth incomparably torment the ſoul, more than all the puniſhment, and tortures, and torments of Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire: Nay, the loſs of that heavenly and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Joy, the loſs of one hours communion with the crowned Saints in glory, the loſs of one glimpſe of the glorified Body of Jeſus Chriſt, is a greater and far more and conſiderable loſs, than the loſs of all the Kingdoms of the World beſides: I know that carnal men have very carnal conceits of Heaven and happineſs, becauſe they look uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon heaven and ſpiritual things with carnal eyes: but if they did but look upon them with ſuch an eye as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27, <hi>By the eye of Faith he ſaw him that was inviſible:</hi> if they would not look upon things that are ſeen, but upon things that are not ſeen; <hi>For, the things that arn ſeen are themporal, but the things that are not ſeen are ſpiritual and eternal,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. If they could but look upon them with ſpiritual eyes, then they would acknowledg, that a thouſand thouſand rendings of the body from the ſoul, are far leſs than one rending of the ſoul from God. It was the ſpeech of one <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus,</hi> a curious Painter, to one that admired at him for looking ſo wiſhfully upon a curious Picture; <hi>Oh,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if thou hadſt but my eyes, thou wouldſt admire what I admire;</hi> ſo may I ſay to men that will not now believe that the loſs of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is ſuch a loſs; hadſt thou but ſpiritual eyes, thou wouldſt acknowledg the truth of what I now ſay, That the loſs of Gods preſence is ſuch a loſs
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45614:98"/>as can never, never, be ſufficiently bewailed, no not with tears of blood. It was the ſpeech of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> and it was a ſavoury ſpeech; <hi>I had rather endure a thouſand Hells, than to hear that one dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſentence, Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his Angels:</hi> And ſuitable to this was the ſpeech of <hi>Auguſtine, I could be contented to endure the torments of Hell for a while, ſo I might but ſee the glorified body of Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven;</hi> for you know what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me,</hi> John 17.24. The ſight of Chriſts glory in heaven, is that which makes heaven to be Heaven. It was a good ſpeech of <hi>Luther, Heaven without Gods preſence, would be but as a Box without a Jewel.</hi> Now if this Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Viſion, as it is called, <hi>the beholding of the glory of Chriſt in Heaven, be ſuch a happineſs;</hi> Oh what is it to be excluded and thruſt out from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified preſence of Chriſt, never to ſee his face! You know when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> told the Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Acts 20.25, 38, <hi>And now behold, that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, ſhall ſee my face no more.</hi> This cut them to the heart, this occaſioned ſo much ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſadneſs, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>You ſhall ſee my face no more:</hi> Now if that were matter of ſo much ſadneſs, never to ſee the Apoſtles face more; Oh, what will it be, when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall ſay to ſuch an one, Thou ſhalt never ſee my face; Go thou curſed wretch, get thee away from me: go to Hell, to the Devil and damned ſpirits: there, there, ſhall be thy portion for ever and ever! This is the firſt Reaſon, to ſhew how unvaluable,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45614:99"/>how unconceivable this loſs is; the coming ſhort of Heaven is the loſs of Gods preſence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Reaſon is this: They that come ſhort of Heaven, as they loſe the preſence of God, ſo they loſe the favour, love, mercy and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God; the favour of God is better than life, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 63.3, <hi>Becauſe thy loving-kindneſs is better than life, my lips ſhall praiſe thee;</hi> becauſe when this life is gone, the favour of God towards his Elect will laſt to all eternity, therefore it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life; but they that come ſhort of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, loſe this favour of God; all pity, all mercy, all compaſſion, all hope of favour ſhall then be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly taken away; God will be ſo far from ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favour to them, that <hi>he will laugh at their deſtruction, and mock when their fear cometh as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and their deſtruction as a whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon them,</hi> as it is <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26, 27: They ſhall loſe not only the favour of God, but the favour of all their Friends that they have enjoyed here upon earth: they ſhall loſe the favour of their Fathers and Mothers, of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Wives, and Children and boſom-Friends: for although they were nearly related to them, yet if they come to heaven, and themſelves excluded, thoſe glorified Saints that are in heaven, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon them with deteſtation and deriſion; nay, they will rejoyce in their deſtruction, and in the execution of Gods juſtice and vengeance upon them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.10, <hi>The righteous ſhall rejoyce when he ſeeth the vengeance;</hi> a glorified Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall rejoyce in the deſtruction and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a damned Son; a glorified Yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in Heaven ſhall rejoyce in the deſtruction and damnation of ſuch a Yoke-fellow as is condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45614:99"/>No prayers, no tears, no ſobs nor ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, no cryings to the mountains to fall upon them, ſhall one whit avail: there ſhall be no Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, none in heaven or earth to plead for them, or to ſpeak one word on their behalf. This is the ſecond Reaſon, They that come ſhort of Heaven, loſe the favour of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They that come ſhort of Heaven, as they loſe the preſence of God, and the favour of God; ſo they loſe the fruition of God, the enjoyment of God in eternal happineſs; they loſe <hi>a Crown that is incorruptible, undefiled, that fades not away, that is reſerved for the Saints in light:</hi> they loſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, an everlaſting inheritance: If the loſs of an earthly comfort (ſuppoſe it be of a dear Wife, or hopeful Child, or a boſom Friend, or an outward Eſtate of an Inheritance of a thouſand pounds a year: if the loſs of a ſtately Houſe, or the loſs of a rich Ship at Sea) doth many times ſo affect a man, that it goes to his very heart; you know what <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>If</hi> Benjamin <hi>be taken away,</hi> my dearly beloved ſon <hi>Benjamin,</hi> then ſaid he, <hi>ſhall I go to my grave mourning; my gray hairs will be brought with ſorrow to the grave,</hi> Gen. 42.38. If an earthly loſs, the loſs of an earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, do ſo affect and afflict a man, O what will the loſs of an everlaſting Kingdom, of everlaſting Glory, of everlaſting Happineſs, of thoſe everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pleaſures that are at the right hand of God, <hi>which eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive;</hi> O how will this loſs torture and torment the ſoul, and make ſuch a one cry out in anguiſh and extream bitterneſs, Oh curſed beaſt that I was, to me was the Goſpel preacht in power and purity; I lived
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:45614:100"/>in a City where heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> was dropping down every day, on the week-day as well as on the Lords day; to me was Jeſus Chriſt proffered in all his beauty and imbroidery: nay, the Miniſters of the Goſpel did woe me, intreat me, invite me, and beſeech me, as if Jeſus Chriſt himſelf had been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knees, beſeeching me to be reconciled; to me was Salvation tendred, but I neglected all, I ſlighted all, and now muſt I for ever endure thoſe torments that might have been eſcaped, and muſt for ever be deprived of thoſe joys that might have been gained: I might have been what now I am not; O that I might be any thing rather than what I now am: O that I might be a Toad, or a Serpent, or any thing, or nothing! The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration therefore of this loſs, the loſs of happineſs, the loſs of ſuch a happineſs, the loſs of an eternal happineſs, will rend the caul of their hearts in a thouſand thouſand pieces: the tears of hell will not be ſufficient to bewail the loſs of Heaven, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if you take in but theſe three aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this loſs.</p>
            <p>1. They that loſe this eternal happineſs, ſhall look upon others that have gained it; they ſhall look upon the Saints and Servants of Chriſt that are now in joy in that unconceivable Glory, whereof themſelves come ſhort, and this will be an eternal Corroſive to their conſciences; ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.28, <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, when ye ſhall ſee Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out;</hi> All the bleſſed Saints and Servants of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into Heaven, and themſelves ſhut out: that is one aggravation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:45614:100"/>2. Take in this aggravation alſo, That this loſs of eternal happineſs, is ever accompanied with the puniſhment of ſenſe; if it were only a puniſhment of loſs, it was a dreadful puniſhment, but the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of loſs never goes alone: they that loſe Heaven, muſt have Hell for their portion: they muſt have thoſe unconceivable tortures and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which infinitely ſurpaſs the capacity and comprehenſion of ſuch poor creatures as we are: Alas! we know not what it is to lye under the burden of Gods wrath: when Mountains and Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones of wrath are thrown upon the ſoul, and the Lord will ſo far enable the ſoul, that it ſhall be bearing that wrath, and bearing, and bearing it to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>3. Take in this aggravation alſo: This loſs it is irrecoverable, once loſt, and ever loſt: Heaven once loſt will never, never be recovered; after as many millions of years as there are drops in the Ocean, that loſs will ſtill be bewailed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed, and bewailed to all Eternity. If you put all theſe together, I believe you will aſſent to me now, and acknowledg the truth of this point; <hi>That to come ſhort of Heaven, is ſuch an unvaluable, and unconceivable, and irrecoverable loſs, that it is to be trembled at by all ſorts of perſons whatſoever:</hi> For the uſe of this point,
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, By way of Information.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, By way of Exhortation:</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Information: It ſhews us the extream folly and madneſs of all impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who will venture the loſs of God, and the favour of God; the loſs of Chriſt, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt; the loſs of heaven and happineſs, and the loſs of their own ſouls, rather than they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:45614:101"/>will loſe the pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon: it is ſuch a madneſs, that heaven and earth may ſtand amazed at it! Conſider, and befool your ſelves, O you carnal and careleſs ones, if you have not ſinned away your very ſenſe and reaſon alſo: Conſider, bluſh, and be aſhamed, and be confounded in the preſence of the Lord this day; you that never yet ſet your faces towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, you that never made it your buſineſs to look out for a Chriſt; you that never ſhed a peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial tear from a broken heart; you that cannot abide to think of Humiliation and Repentance; you that never ſought for eternal happineſs by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing; you that know not what it is to mortifie a luſt: you that know not what it is to deny your own hearts any thing, to croſs your own wills in any thing: you that are ſo far from working out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling, that you work out your own damnation without fear and trembling, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horror and aſtoniſhment: that never once think of it, that never once lay to heart this loſs, this coming ſhort; I cannot, if I had the tongue of men and Angels, I were not able to expreſs the evil of coming ſhort of eternal happineſs; you can now ſell Glory for vanity; Heaven for Earth; the pleaſures that are at the right hand of God, for the pleaſures of ſin that are but for a ſeaſon: But the time will come, when with heart-rending complaints, you will tear off your own hair, and rend your own hearts in pieces, and cry out, O fools, beaſtly fools, ſenſleſs ſots that we were, to bereave our ſelves of eternal happineſs, for a little momentany pleaſures, for the ſatisfaction of a baſe luſt! O what Bedlams, O what humane
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45614:101"/>beaſts were we, that would deprive our ſelves of manſions in the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for a few bruitiſh carnal ſenſual delights! O what mad-men were we, that would venture the loſs of an eternal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in that place, where to be, and to be moſt happy, is all one! rather than we would croſs our own carnal and corrupt wills in any thing, we would fulfil the fleſh, and the mind: O how will you then exceedingly befool your ſelves? It is ſtoried of <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> a King, being purſued by his Enemies, and being very thirſty, he ſold his Kingdom for a draught of drink: but afterward he cryed out, Alas, What a bargain have I made, to ſell my Kingdom for a draught of drink! O this, even this, is the condition of all you that ſell Heaven for Earth, that ſell Pearls for Pebles, that ſell your immortal Souls, that ſell the hopes of eternal happineſs, for the ſatisfaction of a baſe luſt: O how will you cry out, What a Bedlam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaſt have I been, that have run ſuch a hazzard, the loſs of ſuch a Crown, an incorruptible Crown, ſuch a Crown of eternal Glory! O what a beaſt have I been, that have ventured the loſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the favour of God, and the preſence of God, and the loſs of my own Soul, and that for nothing, for toys and trifles, for droſs and traſh! You can now complain of the Service of God, and ſay, It is an unprofitable Service; <hi>What profit is it to wait upon the Lord? what profit is it that we kept his Ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> Mal. 3.14. But a time will come, when you will wiſh that a thouſand years had been ſpent in faſting, and ten thouſand thouſand years had been ſpent in the ſtricteſt Exerciſe of Religion, rather than you
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45614:102"/>ſhould have come ſhort of that eternal happineſs; you now are ready to ſay, when the Miniſters preſs you to pray in your Families, and catechiſe your Families, and read the Scriptures in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and to drive a Trade for Heaven: when we preſs you to theſe things, you are ready to ſay, We have no leiſure: alas, we cannot look after theſe things, we have no time to ſeek hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and happineſs: No time! Well, well, you that can find no time to look after thoſe things that are of infinite concernment; you that have no time to ſeek for Heaven, you will have time enough to bewail the loſs of Heaven, when a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years are gone, and ten thouſand years are gone, and a thouſand, thouſand, thouſand years are gone in bewailing your loſs, bewailing this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable damage and detriment: when as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of years are gone as there are drops of water in the Ocean, there will be time enough to bewail it to all eternity; O the folly and madneſs of all thoſe that will live in ſin, and lye in ſin; and for the pleaſures of ſin, will venture the loſs of thoſe pleaſures that are at the right hand of God for evermore! it is ſuch madneſs as cannot be expreſſed or conceived. That is one Uſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By way of Exhortation: And I have two Exhortations to tender to you, if God would give you but hearts to hearken: and the Lord of his infinite mercy bow and incline your hearts to conſider what I ſay.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If the coming ſhort of this eternal Reſt, be ſuch an unconceivable loſs: Then, foreſee this danger, and tremble at it, tremble at the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it; if you be fleſh and blood, tremble at it: Think with your ſelves, certainly there
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45614:102"/>will come a day, when a final Sentence muſt paſs upon my ſoul, either a ſentence of Abſolution, or a ſentence of Condemnation: if the ſentence of Condemnation, <hi>Depart from me thou curſed wretch, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Matth. 25.41. If that ſhould be the final Sentence that ſhould paſs upon me, what would become of me! As God ſpeaks to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Judg, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.3, <hi>And what will you do in the day of viſitation, and in the deſolation which will come from far? to whom will ye flee for help?</hi> So ſay I to thee: What wilt thou do in the day when that ſentence paſſeth upon thee? Whither wilt thou flee for help? O the weeping, and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gnaſhing of teeth, that this coming ſhort of Heaven will produce; eſpecially when thou ſhalt conſider, that God was every day dealing with thee, ſtretching out his hand to have gathered thee, and to have converted thee, and to have brought thee home, but thou wouldſt not! Jeſus Chriſt offered me a plaiſter of his own heart-blood to heal me, but I trampled it under-foot; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God was knocking at the door of my heart, ſometimes by the Hammer of the Law, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Hammer of the Goſpel; the Spirit of God was hindering me from ſin, and was ſtirring up holy motions in my heart, and thoſe I quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Miniſters of the Goſpel they preſt hard upon me to yield to thoſe warnings, frequent warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that were tendred to me: but the Miniſters I deſpifed; and I mockt the Meſſengers of God, which he ſent to me to warn me not to come into this place of torment: O the horrible, helliſh, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous cryes, the fearful and doleful ſcreetches, roarings and yellings, that theſe conſiderations
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45614:103"/>will fetch from thee, when thou ſhalt conſider that thou haſt not obeyed the Goſpel, thou haſt not known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace; but thou haſt wilfully loſt ſuch a Crown, ſuch a Kingdom, ſuch happineſs, as will be matter of heart-tormenting ſorrow and mourning to all eternity; if the loſs of the Ark, which was but a type of Gods preſence, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.18, 19, 20, was ſo terrible to that good old man <hi>Eli,</hi> that he fell down and brake his neck, when he heard of the loſs of it; and to that good woman, <hi>Phinehas,</hi> in her Travel, when the Ark was loſt, that ſhe cryed out, <hi>The glory is departed from Iſrael!</hi> O what then think you will be the loſs of Gods preſence, the loſs of his Favour, the loſs of eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the loſs of this Crown and Kingdom which I have been ſpeaking of! Oh, how will this make ſuch damned wretches cry out in extream bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, The Glory, the Kingdom, the happineſs: the Glory, the everlaſting Glory is departed from me, and I muſt never ſee the face of God any more! This is the firſt Exhortation; Foreſee this evil, and tremble at it.</p>
            <p>My ſecond Exhortation is this: Do not only foreſee this danger, but ſtudy with the utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of your ſouls to prevent it: Prevent it, you will ſay, How muſt I do that? I will tell you that, if God will but give you hearts to follow my counſel.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Be ſure to avoid thoſe ſins that clog, and hamper, and fetter thee as it were in the way to Heaven; ſo that thou canſt not with any patience run the Race that is ſet before thee; ſuch as theſe: Pride, Preſumption, Unbelief, Apoſtacy, Earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Selfiſhneſs, Security and Senſuality: O theſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45614:103"/>are the ſins that fetter thee, and hamper thee, away with them therefore.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Pluck up thy feet, and reſolve to run the ways of Gods Commandments: pray with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that God would <hi>enlarge your hearts that you may run in the way of his Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.32. He doth not beg that the way may be made large, but that his heart may be enlarged: <hi>I will walk in the way of thy Commandments,</hi> though it be never ſo narrow, though there be never ſo many croſſes in it, or thorns, or difficulties, or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements: <hi>if thou wilt but enlarge my heart, I will run in the ways of thy Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Take heed of delays and procraſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of putting it off from day to day, by ſaying, there will be time enough hereafter; it will be time enough for me to look after Heaven, when I have got enough of the World; If I do it the laſt year of my life, in the laſt month of the laſt year, in the laſt week of the laſt month, it will ſerve; O take heed of delays, this putting off of Repentance hath ruined thouſands of Souls; ſhun that Pit wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many have fallen: ſhun that Rock upon which many have ſuffered ſhip-wrack; ſay with <hi>David, I made haſte, and delayed not to keep thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Pſal. 119.60.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Look upon the Crown of Glory ſet before thee; have the Goal in thy Eye, juſt as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had: he endured the frowns of <hi>Pharoah</hi> on the one hand, and he ſcorned the flatteries and Riches of <hi>Egypt</hi> on the other hand: Why? becauſe he had an Eye to the <hi>recompence of Reward;</hi> O look upon the Crown and white Robe, and let this quicken you.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Be ſure thou hold out unto the end:
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45614:104"/>if thou wouldſt not come ſhort of Heaven, be not like many runners in a Race, that ſit down in the midſt of the way; <hi>Be thou faithful unto the death,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> Revel. 2.10, <hi>and I will give thee a crown of life; He that endures to the end ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Matth. 24.13. Therefore, <hi>be ſtedfaſt and unmovable, always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord;</hi> abhor Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy as much as thou wouldſt abhor Hell it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now to preſs this Exhortation upon you, take theſe Motives:</p>
            <p>Firſt, If you have but willing minds, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>for if there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12. If thou uſeſt the utmoſt endeavour of thy Soul, the Lord will help thee; if thou faint, he will ſupport thee; if thou overcome, he will Crown thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider, that among runners in a Race here on Earth, there is but one that will get the Goal; I, but here in the Race of Chriſtianity, if thou do but ſo run, thou mayſt obtain: <hi>If thou do not ſit down, if thou art not weary of well-doing; If thou by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory and immortality, there is eternal life for thee, thou ſhalt have a Crown of glory;</hi> Nay, there are ten thouſand, thouſand Crowns in Heaven. The Lord Chriſt will give every one a Crown, that holds out to the end, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8, <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judg ſhall give me at that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, why doth he call it a Crown of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:45614:104"/>Anſwer, It is called <hi>a Crown of Righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe it is a Crown purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, and a Crown that is promiſed. Now ſaith the Apoſtle, This righteous Crown, or this Crown of Righteouſneſs, is laid up for me, and not only for me; there is not only one Crown and one Kingdom for me, but it is laid up for all thoſe that love the appearing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. O this glorious Maſter! He makes every one of his Servants to be crowned Kings: <hi>He hath made us Kings unto God,</hi> Rev. 1.6.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider the time of running is but ſhort, but the time of your Reward will be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; if you do not come ſhort of this eternal Reſt, but hold out, and run to the end of the Race: If you can but ſay with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have been faithful unto the death; I have not wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly departed from my God,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.21. If you be not Apoſtates, but hold out to the end, know that your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord. O the unconceivable Reward! O the invaluable and unconceiveable Bliſs of all thoſe that come to this eternal Reſt! The tongue of Men and Angels is not able to expreſs it. I beſeech you on the one ſide, fear the loſs of it: and on the other ſide, let the conſideration of that eternal happineſs, quicken you to do the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of your endeavours to attain it; If you had ten thouſand lives to ſpend in the ſervice of God; if you had ten thouſand Eſtates to lay down at his feet; if you could do as much as all the Apoſtles did, and all the Martyrs did or ſuffered; let me tell you, the fruition of Jeſus Chriſt one day in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:45614:105"/>glory, will recompence it all. The Lord work theſe things upon our hearts, that every one of us here preſent may fear exceedingly and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; leſt a Promiſe being left of entring into his Reſt, we ſhould forſake the Promiſe, and by forſa ing the Promiſe, ſhould come ſhort of eternal Happineſs.</p>

            <p>THE ſeven famous Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> mentioned in the three firſt Chapters of this Book of <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> had this honour put upon them, to have ſeven Epiſtles ſent unto them immediately from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; and as they were the glory of the World, while they ſtood faſt to God and to his Truth, ſo were they after their decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from God and his Truth, made the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his anger and indignation. The words I have now read unto you, are part of the ſixth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, written from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> wherein, as he was a faithful Witneſs, and one that knew their ſpiritual Eſtate better than they knew it themſelves: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſets down in his Epiſtle ſomething by way of
<list>
                  <item>Commendation,</item>
                  <item>Conſolation,</item>
                  <item>Exhortation.</item>

            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:45614:106"/>Something is ſet down here by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, in <hi>ver.</hi> 8, <hi>I know thy works, behold, I have ſet before thee an open door, and no man can ſhut it;</hi> By <hi>open door</hi> may be meant, either a free and full liberty and opportunity of ſpreading the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as the Apoſtle uſes that phraſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9, <hi>For a great door and effectual is opened to me, and there are many adverſaries;</hi> or elſe by <hi>open door</hi> may be meant a door of Hope, in reference to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; that door of Heaven that ſin had ſhut againſt us, is by the merit of Jeſus Chriſt opened to us: Oh, bleſſed are they that have this door open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Door, the Way, the Truth, and the Life; but ſays he, <hi>Thou haſt a little ſtrength, and haſt kept my word, and haſt not denied my name.</hi> This is by way of Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though ſhe had but a little ſtrength, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe improved it, and did not deny the name of Chriſt, was not an Apoſtate Church, this our Saviour puts upon her account of Commendation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is ſomething alſo by way of Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in <hi>ver.</hi> 9.10, <hi>Behold, I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan, which ſay they are Jews and are not;</hi> (that is, I will diſcover their Hypocriſie, I will make them known to be what they are, and reveal to whom they do belong) <hi>I will make them to come and worſhip before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee;</hi> that is, I will ſubdue thy Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under thy feet, and let them know that I have loved thee; and in <hi>ver.</hi> 10, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience, I alſo will keep thee from the hour of temptation which ſhall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth:</hi> Here is marvellous comfort; Jeſus Chriſt never brings his Children into a Wilderneſs, but he goes
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45614:106"/>with them: when they go through the fire, and through the water, he will be with them: <hi>I will keep thee, and I will uphold thee,</hi> ſays he.</p>
            <p>Then in the third place, Here is ſomething by way of Exhortation in the words of the Text: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I come quickly, hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy Crown:</hi> In which words there are two things conſiderable:
<list>
                  <item>1. A Duty preſſed.</item>
                  <item>2. Motives expreſſed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Duty preſſed, is Conſtancy and Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>Hold faſt that which thou haſt.</hi> The Motives expreſſed are two: the one is drawn from the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs of Chriſts coming to Judgment, <hi>Behold I come quickly;</hi> the other is taken from the danger of loſing their Crown ſet before them, <hi>That no man take thy Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Duty preſſed, <hi>Hold faſt that thou haſt;</hi> keep it with might and main, uſe thy utmoſt endeavour to keep what thou haſt: What was that this Church had which Chriſt exhorts to hold faſt? It had both the profeſſion and poſſeſſion of true Religion: Now this true Religion conſiſted in two things, in purity of Doctrine, and in holineſs of Life and Converſation; both theſe this Church had: ſhe had purity of Doctrine, as I ſhewed you out of <hi>ver.</hi> 8, <hi>Thou haſt kept my Word, and haſt not denied my Name;</hi> thou haſt kept my Word. Then for holineſs of Converſation; ſhe had not denied Chriſts Name in the midſt of Perſecution, <hi>Thou haſt kept theword of my patience;</hi> Now ſays our Saviour, <hi>that which thou haſt,</hi> that true Religion thou profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, maintain and keep, &amp; hold faſt againſt all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both in profeſſion and practice; hold faſt the truth thou haſt embraced, and hold faſt the grace
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45614:107"/>that thou haſt received: So then the Doctrine I ſhall commend to you hence, is this:</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That Chriſtians muſt hold faſt, both the Truth and the grace they have received, with Conſtancy and Perſeverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two branches in this Doctrine, which we might make two Propoſitions:
<list>
                  <item>The firſt this, <hi>That Chriſtians muſt hold faſt the truths they have received, with Conſtancy and Perſeverance.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The ſecond this: <hi>That Chriſtians muſt hold faſt the grace they have received, with Conſtancy and Perſeverance.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt, <hi>That Chriſtians muſt hold faſt the truths they have received, with Conſtancy and Perſeverance.</hi> For the proof of this, conſider that place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, <hi>Hold faſt the form of ſound words which thou haſt heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jeſus;</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that Model, or that Plat-form of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Truths, thoſe fundamental Truths which the Apoſtle had wrapt up in a bundle to be received and embraced; ſo <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9, <hi>Holding faſt the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by ſound Doctrine, both to exhort and convince gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> holding faſt the faithful word; as Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries pluck one way, ſo do you pluck another way, ſtriving earneſtly for the faith of the Goſpel. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23, <hi>Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed:</hi> Prov. 4.13, <hi>Take faſt hold of inſtruction, let her not go: keep her, for ſhe is thy life.</hi> Prov. 23.23, <hi>Buy the truth, and ſell it not;</hi> buy it at any rate, ſell it at no rate: thus you ſee this Duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; ſee it commended in one Example moſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45614:107"/>remarkable and imitable, becauſe it was in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt times, the Primitive-time of the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42, <hi>And they continued stedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better explication of this Point, it may be demanded.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How muſt Chriſtians hold faſt the truth they have received?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Why muſt Chriſtians hold faſt the truth they have received?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How muſt Chriſtians hold faſt the truth they ave received?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer: They muſt hold it faſt theſe three ways:</p>
            <p>In their
<list>
                  <item>Memories,</item>
                  <item>Affections,</item>
                  <item>Practice and Converſations.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. They muſt hold faſt the truth in their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip:</hi> We ſhould learn of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, That <hi>ſhe kept all theſe things, and pondered them in her heart,</hi> Luke 2.19. It is not the great getter, but the great ſaver that becomes the rich man; it is not the hearing, but the keeping of Truths that will make us ſpiritually Rich.</p>
            <p>2. We muſt hold faſt the truth in our Affections, we muſt cleave to the truth in love and liking; thus did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.31, <hi>I have ſtuck unto thy teſtimonies, O Lord, put me not to ſhame;</hi> and in <hi>ver.</hi> 20, <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the longing that it
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45614:108"/>hath unto thy Judgments at all time; O how love I thy Law! it is my meditation all the day,</hi> Ver. 97, and <hi>ver.</hi> 167 of the ſame Pſalm: <hi>My ſoul hath kept thy teſtimonies, and I love them exceedingly.</hi> On the contrary, when men have not a ſincere love to the Truth, they loſe both the Truth and their own Souls too, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved; and for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all might be damned who believe not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> This is the caſe of many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Atheiſts at this day: they are drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to believe lyes, lying miracles, lying doctrines; when God ſees men careleſs and remiſs in their love to the Truth, he ſays to ſuch careleſs wretches, Take him Jeſuit, take him Satan; bind him and blind him, and lead him to deſtruction. Hence are all thoſe frequent Exhortations which are fcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down in the Scripture, to love Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Underſtanding and Inſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.3, <hi>My ſon, forget not my Law, but let thine heart keep my Commandments; let not mercy and truth forſake thee, bind them about thy neck, write them upon the table of thine heart.</hi> Prov. 4.6, <hi>Forſake not wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſhe ſhall preſerve thee; love her, and ſhe ſhall keep thee.</hi> Prov. 7.4, <hi>Say unto Wiſdom thou art my ſiſter, and call <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding thy kinſwoman.</hi> What a man loves, that he will keep carefully: if he loves a Jewel he will be careful to preſerve it; if he loves a Picture, he will be careful not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face it; a man will part with that laſt, which he loves beſt.</p>
            <p>3. Hold faſt the Truth, not only in Memory and Affection, but likewiſe hold faſt the truth in Practice
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45614:108"/>and Converſation; you ſhould yield conſcionable ſubjection to every known Truth, without holding any one part of the Truth in unrighteouſneſs: the more a man practiſeth what he knows, the more he ſhall know what to practice, <hi>John</hi> 7.17, <hi>If any man will do his Will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> True knowledg is the mother of Obedience, but obedience is thenurſe of Knowledg: when a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hath taken out one Leſſon well, it is an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to a Maſter to teach him another; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if we would practice more, we ſhould know more: <hi>The ſecrets of the Lord are with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 25.14. Look as the Widows oyl by laying it out was encreaſed, ſo knowledg laid out in practice is put forth to advantage; therefore put forth every known truth into practice: This is the way to hold faſt the Truth you have received.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Quaery</hi> by way of Explication is this; But why muſt Chriſtians hold faſt the truth they have received, with Conſtaney and Perſeverance?</p>
            <p>The Reaſons are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Truth hath many Enemies to oppoſe it, corrupt it, gainſay it, malign it, deface it, and diſgrace it; though Truth cannot be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet it is many times blamed; Jeſus Chriſt himſelf had not more Enemies upon Earth, than his Truth hath at this day; yea, our bleſſed Saviour had the more Enemies, becauſe he did bear witneſs to the Truth: <hi>John</hi> 8.40, <hi>But now you ſeek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God; this did not Abraham.</hi> That was the great quarrel they had againſt our Saviour, becauſe he told them the truth. Now as Jeſus Chriſt, the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45614:109"/>Way, the Truth, and the Life, was oppoſed, ſo will his Truth be oppoſed to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Devil is a grand Enemy to the Truth; that Prince of darkneſs would not willingly have one Lamp of the Sanctuary unblown out: the moſt of his rage is againſt the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, who hold forth the word of Truth to Gods people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Ignorant, Unbelieving, Atheiſtical wretches, that count Preaching fooliſhneſs, that will be ready to undervalue it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Subtile and undermining Prieſts and Jeſuits: thoſe Frogs out of the bottomleſs pit, they will endeavour to corrupt it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. Scandalous Proteſtants, which bring not forth fruit, theſe will caſt an aſperſion and ſcandal upon the Truth; therefore becauſe of theſe Enemies, Chriſtians ſhould hold forth the truth they have received; That's the firſt Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond reaſon is this: Truth is worth the holding faſt, becauſe we have many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed priviledges by it, as for Example:</p>
            <p>1. The truth of the Goſpel is our Cap of Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; it is the Charter of our Priviledges, it is the evidence of our everlaſting Inheritance: <hi>Thy Teſtimonies have I claimed for my heritage,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> And will you not keep your evidences for a good Inheritance?</p>
            <p>2. Here is another Priviledg: If you will keep the Truth, you may be ſure the Truth will keep you; as we ſay of a Tradeſman, <hi>If he will keep his Shop, his Shop will keep him.</hi> The truth will be your Shield and Buckler, if you keep it, to defend you againſt all gainſayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.4, <hi>He ſhall cover her with his feathers, and under his wings ſhalt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:45614:109"/>thou truſt,</hi> his truth ſhall be thy Shield and Buckler; hold faſt the Faith, and that will hold you up; the Apoſtle bids us in one place, to <hi>ſtand faſt in the faith,</hi> Rom. 11.20, and in another place, <hi>by faith we ſtand,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.24. From both thoſe places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, you may gather thus much: when we ſtand in it, then we ſtand by it: when we ſtand faſt in the Faith, then we ſhall be ſure to be eſtabliſhed by the Faith againſt all oppoſitions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The holding faſt the Truth, will yield and afford you the ſweeteſt joy and comfort upon your Death-beds: What was that made Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyce at death? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith;</hi> He had not let go his hold; this was the ground of his joy and hope, when he was <hi>ready to be offered, and his departure was at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The truth of the Goſpel is a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſealed with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo many precious, rich, and royal Legacies are bequeathed unto us, by the Teſtator our bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, our deareſt Friend, that hath redeemed us with his own precious blood. Now, ſhall we not look after the proving of the Will of this bleſſed Teſtator? So much for the Explication.</p>
            <p>Now for the Application of this Point; And the firſt Uſe is by way of Reproof; does not this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine juſtly and ſharply reprove the unconſtancy and unſetledneſs of many Profeſſors at this day? Doth it not meet them as the Angel did <hi>Balaam,</hi> with a drawn Sword of a ſharp reproof? O that this Reproof might take hold on thoſe that are concerned this day; you know we read that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage this day, <hi>What went ye out into the wilderneſs to ſee? a reed ſhaken with the wind?</hi> No, <hi>John
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:45614:110"/>Baptiſt</hi> was not a Reed, but a Rock; But alas, look upon Profeſſors at this day, and we have more Reeds than Rocks, we have more falling than fixed Stars: More Children that are carried about with every wind of Doctrine (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14.) than men ſetled, rooted, and ſtabliſhed in the preſent truth, that are conſtant in nothing but unconſtancy: are there not ſome that can be content to part with Religion, and let Truth go, and Goſpel-priviledges go, and all go, ſo they may but enjoy their Trades and Profeſſions, their places and preferments: (though I hope better things of many of you that hear me this day): will not the Lord, think you, ſharply rebuke ſuch in his anger? will he not ſpeak to them in his hot diſpleaſure? What, have I given you the Goſpel, ſuch precious Truths, and do you ſlight them! do you trample them under feet! do you prefer the puddles of Popery, before theſe wholſom ſtreams and clear fountain of Truth? Well, if the Goſpel be a burthen to you, I will eaſe you of your burthen; and how doleful would this be, if God ſhould ſay, the priviledges you are weary of, ſhall be taken from you, you ſhall be eaſed of them!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Therefore give me leave in the Name of Chriſt, and in the cauſe of the Goſpel, to beſeech you to hold faſt that which you have received: hold faſt the Truth againſt Errour, hold faſt the truth of the Proteſtant Religion againſt Popery, and Popiſh Innovations and Superſtitions: this I forewarn you of, the rather upon this account, becauſe there are ſome among us which are well conceited of that curſed Religion, becauſe they never have ſmarted under the Antichriſtian tyranny, as our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done: they have forgotten the blood
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:45614:110"/>of our Martyrs that was ſhed in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days: Nay, that blood that was ſpilt in <hi>Ireland</hi> but twenty one years ago; therefore that you may be fenced againſt the flatteries and inſinuations of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Doctrine, take notice that Popiſh Religion is an Idolatrous Religion; they are guilty of as groſs Idolatry as every was practiſed among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: for,</p>
            <p>1. They worſhip the Saints with a religious worſhip, which is proper to God only; they pray to Saints departed, which is a diſhonour to God the Father, and Jeſus Chriſt the only Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man: They pray to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and make her their Redeemer, by praying to her, ſaying, <hi>Save us, O Savioureſs, and redeem us, and in the hour of death receive us.</hi> This is a great diſhonour to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; What can be greater Idolatry than this, to attribute that to a creature, which is proper only to the Creator?</p>
            <p>2. They ſet up Images to be worſhipped con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſecond Commandment, which ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven image, nor how down to it, nor worſhip it,</hi> &amp;c. But they will object and ſay, They do not worſhip the Image, but God in the Image. I anſwer, Neither did the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> worſhip the golden Calf, but they thought they worſhipped God, in or under the Image of the golden Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.4, yet it was groſs Idolatry, as appears, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ye idolaters as were ſome of them; as it is written, the people ſate down to eat and to drink and roſe up to play.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Their Idolatry exceeds the Idolatry of the Heathen, in that they worſhip a piece of Bread, or the bread Tranſubſtantiated (as they call it) into
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:45614:111"/>the body of Chriſt. Now, if the body of Chriſt be in Heaven, as we are ſure it is, as appears by that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21, <hi>Whom the heaven muſt receive until the time of reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets ſince the world began;</hi> The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>the heaven muſt receive him until the time of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all things,</hi> that is, until the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: It Chriſts body be in Heaven, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they worſhip not the body of Chriſt, but a piece of Bread; and what more abominable Idolatry than this? One of their own Religion, <hi>Coſterus,</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, It is more tolerable to worſhip a Dog, or a Cat, or a Crocodile, than to worſhip a piece of Bread: This their Idolatry is a great ſtumbling-block both to the Jews and Heathens: Therefore <hi>Averroes,</hi> a great Philoſopher, being asked why he would not be a Chriſtian? becauſe, ſays he, <hi>The Chriſtians eat the God they worſhip;</hi> therefore, ſays he, <hi>Let my Soul be among the Philoſophers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, As they are Idolaters in their worſhip, ſo they are erroneous in their Doctrines; witneſs their doctrine of Juſtification, denying the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, and truſting to their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: witneſs their doctrine of Merits by Works, yea, their doing works of ſupererogation: witneſs their Popiſh pardons, and Purgatory-ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as if the ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt were imperfect: witneſs their robbing of Jeſus Chriſt of all his Offices, both as King, Prieſt, and Prophet, as might eaſily be proved. In brief, the Popiſh Religion is a looſe and licentious Religion, a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerating Religion; for the Pope can diſpence with murthering of Princes, and the like, if it will promote his intereſt; forbidding Prieſts marriage,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:45614:111"/>and yet ſuffering at the ſame time Stews and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel-houſes. It was a ſaying of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh, Were I to chuſe a Religion for liberty and wickedneſs, I would chuſe the Popiſh Religion;</hi> therefore in Gods fear, hold faſt the truth againſt Popery: And hold it faſt likewiſe againſt the errour of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> which advances mans free-Will above Gods free-Grace: And hold faſt the Truth againſt <hi>Socinians,</hi> that deny the Divinity of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. In brief, be rooted, ſetled and eſtabliſhed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent truth; ſtick cloſe unto the Word of God, as <hi>David</hi> did: ſtand for it, plead for it; chuſe to loſe Liberty, Eſtates, Comforts, Life and all, rather than to part with the Truth. <hi>David</hi> made the Truth his Inheritance: Now as <hi>Naboth</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ahab, The Lord forbid it me, that I ſhould give the Inheritance of my Fathers unto thee,</hi> 1 Kings 21.3. Could he ſay ſo of a temporal Inheritance, and ſhall not we ſay ſo of a ſpiritual Inheritance, which is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us by the blood of Martyrs? Shall the Miniſters of the Goſpel have cauſe to complain, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.3, <hi>And they bend their tongue like their bow for lyes: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth?</hi> Shall we deal with the truth as the Prieſt and Levite did with the man that went down from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho,</hi> and fell among Thieves, left him wounded, and half dead, nay, dying in the ſtreets? Hath God ſaid, <hi>Buy the truth, and ſell it not,</hi> Prov 23, and ſhall we ſell it for our luſts and profits? God forbid. Conſider who it was that abode not in the truth: it was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, a Lyar, who hath no truth in him, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. Even ſo all wicked men are ſaid to be <hi>deſtitute of the truth, and to hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1.18: that is, they ſtrive againſt the light of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:45614:112"/>truth in their hearts: thoſe common principles of truth which they had in their underſtandings, they ſuppreſſed and choaked, that ſo they might ſin more freely; but God forbid that we ſhould do ſo. Will not this make the Spirit of truth to forſake us, when we forſake the truth? What an heroical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was that in holy <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.8, <hi>For we can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth?</hi> Oh what an honour is it to a Chriſtian, when truth hath ſuch ſoveraignty in his heart, that it is dearer to him than his own life! <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9, <hi>Holding faſt the faithful Word:</hi> Hold forth the word of Life, and hold faſt the word of Truth: hold forth the word of Life by a true profeſſion and converſation, and hold faſt the word of truth by courage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and reſolution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But may be you will ask me, <hi>What means may we uſe thus to hold faſt the truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer briefly:</p>
            <p>1. Embrace the truth, not only in the light of it, but in the love of it; what you love, you will be ſure not to part with: Oh, get your hearts fired with love to the truths of the Goſpel, that you may ſay, Lord, I love thy truth exceedingly!</p>
            <p>2. Love not the truth for the perſon's ſake, but love the perſon for the truths ſake; love no mans parts or perſon to admire him, and be a folower of him farther than he follows Chriſt, <hi>Be ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1, ſaith the Apoſtle. It was a great fault in <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> Gal. 2.13, that he was carried away by <hi>Peters</hi> diſſimulation; by his admiring <hi>Peters</hi> perſon ſo much; by his reſting and relying too much upon <hi>Peter,</hi> he fell into <hi>Peters</hi> errour.</p>
            <p>3. Be ever jealous of your own ſtrength, and truſt
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:45614:112"/>not too much to your own ability; this will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to leave you to your ſelves, and then you will fall fearfully, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10, <hi>For when I am weak, then am I ſtrong;</hi> when I am weakeſt in my ſelf, then am I ſtrongeſt in a Saviour; but when I am ſtrongeſt in my ſelf, in my own opinion, then am I weakeſt in a Saviour; no man ſtands by his own ſtrength, for by humane ſtrength can none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</p>
            <p>4. And laſtly, Get your hearts eſtabliſhed with grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9, <hi>It is a good thing that the heart be eſtabliſhed with grace;</hi> be ballaſted with grace, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies: A Ship that is well balaſted, is not ſo ready and apt to reel, as one that is not; and when the Apoſtle puts in a caveat againſt unſetledneſs and falling from grace, what means does he preſcribe? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18, <hi>Ye therefore, beloved, ſeeing ye know theſe things before, beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the errour of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs; but grow in grace, and in the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſays he: O that you and I could grow more in grace; O that we could grow more in the practical part of Religion, in our hearts and houſes, in our lives and converſations: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you therefore, hearken to this firſt Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Duty here preſt upon you, namely, to hold faſt the truth you have received: hold it faſt in your memories, in your affections, and in your converſations: ſo much for the firſt branch of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>That Chriſtians muſt hold faſt the truth they have received, with constancy and perſeverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the ſecond Propoſition, or ſecond branch of the Doctrine, that is this,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:45614:113"/>
               <q>Chriſtians muſt hold faſt that Grace that they have received, with conſtancy and perſeverance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For the proof of this, the Scripture is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly plain and pregnant: in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.23, <hi>Teach me the way of thy Statutes, O Lord, and I will keep it to the end.</hi> Matth. 24.13, <hi>He that endures to the end, he ſhall be ſaved;</hi> it is not ſetting our feet in the way of Chriſtianity, but it is a continuance in that courſe that will bring you to the end of your hopes, the ſalvation of your ſouls: So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14, <hi>We are made partakers of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:</hi> this will be an evidence that we are partakers of Chriſt indeed, if we perſevere and continue in the grace we have received, to the end of our days: ſo we are commanded to <hi>ſerve the Lord,</hi> not ſome few days, <hi>but all the days of our lives:</hi> Luke 1.75, <hi>He that puts his hands to the Plow, and looks back</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>is not fit for the kingdom of God,</hi> Luke 9. <hi>ult.</hi> and in <hi>John</hi> 8.31, <hi>If you continue in my words, then are you my diſciples indeed;</hi> without this perſeverance, we are but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, not real Diſciples. But if you ask me, Why muſt Chriſtians continue in grace, and hold faſt the grace they have received? Hear but ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Arguments, ſtrongly pleading for this truth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Unleſs Chriſtians hold faſt the grace and holineſs they have received, they loſe all they have, and all they hope for: All they have, <hi>viz.</hi> Their preſent endeavours; and all they hope for, their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reward.</p>
            <p>1. They lofe all they have: all their praying, reading, hearing, and communicating, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelves before God; all this will be loſt if they do not perſevere; does not God himſelf ſay
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:45614:113"/>ſo; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, <hi>When the righteous turneth away from his righteouſneſs,</hi> (he does not ſpeak there of one truly and really righteous in a ſtate of grace, one that is ſavingly righteous) <hi>when he turns away from his righteouſneſs, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth, ſhall he live? all the righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned: in his treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſſed, and in his ſin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die.</hi> So that a man loſeth all he hath done in the buſineſs of Religion. Saith <hi>Hierom, We muſt be judged, not by our paſt, but by our preſent condition. As the Tree falls, ſo it lyes: as death leaves us, ſo ſhall judgment find us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. He loſeth all he hopes for too, for the Crown is promiſed to none but to thoſe that do hold out: <hi>Be thou faithful to the death, and thou ſhalt receive a Crown of life,</hi> Rev. 2.10. Chriſtianity is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Race: <hi>Let us run the race that is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us,</hi> Heb. 12.1. Now as in a Race, it is not enough for a man to begin well, but he muſt hold out, elſe he loſeth the Gole; ſo is it in the Race of Chriſtianity; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſo run that you may obtain;</hi> not only run, but <hi>ſo run,</hi> that you may not loſe the Gole, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such as Chriſts love is to us, ſuch muſt our love to Chriſt be. Chriſts love to us is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and unchangeable love: <hi>whom he loves, he loves to the end,</hi> John 13.1. The Lord Chriſt is not only the <hi>beginner, but the finiſher of our faith,</hi> Heb. 12.2. He did not leave the work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imperfect, but he held out until he came to <hi>conſummatum eſt,</hi> till he cryed out upon the Croſs, <hi>it is finiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reaſon Third, may be this: Chriſtians muſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:45614:114"/>hold faſt the grace they have received, becauſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatizing and turning our backs upon God is a moſt dangerous, damnable, ſoul-deſtroying ſin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is dangerous in the Original of it: it ſprings from four bitter roots.</p>
            <p>1. It ſprings from Infidenlity, or Unbelief: <hi>take heed,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelieſ, in departing from the living God,</hi> Heb. 3.12. Unbelief is a damnable ſin, where it is not bemoaned, bewailed, and ſtriven againſt; but reigning unbelief is a damnable ſin; ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. <hi>ult. He that believes not, ſhall be damned: And he that believes not, the wrath of God abides upon him for ever,</hi> John 3. <hi>ult.</hi> Now this Infidelity makes the ſoul depart from God, and it makes God depart from the ſoul; It was a great obſervation of an eminent Divine, now with God; Look as the firſt return of the ſoul to God is by Faith, (for Faith ſets the Soul in joint, it brings Chriſt and the Soul together) ſo the firſt departing of the Soul from God is by unbelief; for from thence comes a departing to other ſins; and this departing to other ſins, encreaſeth our unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and unbelief being encreaſed, the rent or breach between God and the Soul is made wider and wider, till at laſt the Soul comes to a total departing from God, and then God totally departs from the Soul; and ſays, Depart from me thou curſed wretch, I know thee not. Now this ſame Apoſtacy it ſprings from Unbelief.</p>
            <p>2. This Apoſtacy ſprings from Hypocriſie; for uſually Hypocriſie ends in Apoſtacy, as I have told you often: <hi>Judas</hi> the Hypocrite, proved <hi>Judas</hi> the Apoſtate; <hi>Amaziah did that that was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart,</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:45614:114"/>2 Chr. 25.2. therefore <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Hypocrite, proved <hi>Amaziah</hi> the Apoſtate. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.37, it is ſaid there, <hi>Their hearts were not upright, neither remained they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</hi> Why were they not ſtedfaſt? why did not they keep conſtant to the ways of God, to the Vows and Covenants made with God? <hi>their hearts were not upright;</hi> where grace is ſincere, it will be laſting; but that which is counterfeit will be loſt; whatever is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, is fading.</p>
            <p>3. It ſprings from Pride and Preſumption: when men think they have grace enough, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs enough, and have gone far enough in the way to Heaven, this is the root of Apoſtacy; there is a gradual as well as a total Apoſtacy; the Saints and Servants of God may be guilty of gradual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy; ſo <hi>Peter</hi> was, though not of total Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy; it was <hi>Peters</hi> preſumption that was one principal cauſe of his fall; lofty Cedars are thrown down with a Tempeſt, when the lower Trees in the Valley ſtand firm and faſt: So likewiſe lofty Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, high in their own conceits, many times neſtle themſelves on high, and their fall is great: whereas Chriſtians that walk humbly, are ſupported and preſerved. Look as a man that gazeth at the Stars, looks up on high, quickly catches a fall, becauſe he looks not to his feet: So a man that is highly conceited in his own opinion, lifts up his head on high, many times catches a feaful fall; it is juſt with God to leave ſuch men to try them. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though a very gracious King, yet when his heart was liſted up with Pride, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25, the Text ſaith, <hi>God left him to himſelf, to try what was in his heart,</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 31. That <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of falling into miſery, is as true of falling and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:45614:115"/>in grace, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.18, <hi>Pride goes before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and a haughty Spirit before a fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Apoſtacy ſprings from Covetouſneſs and worldlineſs; look as the ſeed in the thorny ground, it brought nothing to perfection, becauſe it was choaked with the cares, riches and pleaſures of this world, as you may read in the Parable of the Sower, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14. So it is here, where the heart is ſtuft with covetouſneſs, and the cares of this life, that is uſually a forerunner of a fearful fall; <hi>Demas hath forſaken me, having embraced this preſent world;</hi> what was the ground of his Apoſtacy, but his worldlineſs and ſelfiſhneſs? ſo that Apoſtacy is dangerous in the Original of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is damnable in the effects of it; for,</p>
            <p>1. This puts Jeſus Chriſt to open ſhame; in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. Apoſtates crucifie Chriſt afreſh, and put him to open ſhame; for by falling away from him, we do as much as tell the world, we have found his ſervice that it was an unprofitable ſervice; the ſervice of the world is better than his ſervice, and that we have not found in Chriſt what we expected: when we turn our backs on Chriſt and go to the world, we do as much as openly proclaim, the world is a better Maſter than Chriſt is. When Soldiers forſake their General, it is a diſhonour to him.</p>
            <p>2. Then it is damnable in the effects of it, becauſe it puts Religion to open ſhame: it makes the Name of God to be blaſphemed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. It is a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the weak: it ſtaves men off from the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion, and it opens the mouth of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to ſpeak evil of the ways of God; thus it is damnable in the effects.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is deſtructive in the end and iſſue of it: for,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:45614:115"/>Firſt, God will reckon Apoſtates amongſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates; <hi>God will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity, thoſe that turn aſide to their crooked ways,</hi> Pſal. 125. <hi>ult.</hi> Lead them forth, that is, put them in the ſame condition with the moſt profligate and ſcandalous ſinner that is.</p>
            <p>2. Their latter end ſhall be worſe than their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as our Saviour ſhews in the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.43, <hi>When the unclean ſpirit is gone out of a man, and returns again, he brings ſeven Devils more, and the end of that man is worſe than his beginning:</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, and the two laſt Verſes, <hi>It had been better men had never known the way of holineſs, than having known it, to turn aſide from the holy commandment:</hi> it fares with them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Proverb, <hi>the Dog is turned to his vomit again, and the Sow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to make Application of this truth, there is one doubt to be reſolved.</p>
            <p>You ſay, Chriſtians muſt hold faſt the grace they have received: Why, may ſome ſay, Can a man that hath received ſaving grace, loſe that grace he hath received?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, No: He cannot loſe ſaving-grace totally or finally; this is <hi>Mary</hi>'s part, which cannot be taken away: <hi>Mary hath choſe that good part which cannot be taken away,</hi> Luke 10.42, The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>he that is born of God, ſins not,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin to death, <hi>becauſe the ſeed of God,</hi> as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſpiritual life, <hi>abideth in him,</hi> 1 John 3.9. therefore he cannot ſin unto death; <hi>the righteous are ſaid to be built on an everlaſting foundation,</hi> Prov. 10.25: that is, he abides unmovable in grace, till grace be turned into glory: and the reaſon of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:45614:116"/>this is, ſaving-grace beſtowed upon the Elect, is built on four immutable and unmovable Pillars.</p>
            <p>1. The love that God bares to his people, it is an everlaſting love, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3, <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love;</hi> we are very fickle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant in our love to God: but God is not fickle or unconſtant in his love to us.</p>
            <p>2. The Covenant of grace is a ſtedfaſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo ſaith <hi>David</hi> in the laſt words of that ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he was to leave the world, <hi>He hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ſure and ſtedfaſt, and ordered in all things,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. It is a Covenant ſealed with the blood of Chriſt, therefore it is called <hi>the blood of the everlaſting Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13.20. this everlaſting Covenant cannot be broken: True indeed, ſin may break the peace of the Covenant, but it cannot break the bond of the Covenant of Grace; it may break the peace of the Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.31, <hi>If thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren break my ſtatutes, and keep not my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then will I viſit their tranſgreſſions with a red, and their iniquities with ſtripes: but I will not ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail, my covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The third Pillar is this, the Power of God, which is irreſiſtible and unconquerable: on this Pillar our bleſſed Saviour builds the ſalvation of his Elect, <hi>John</hi> 10.29, <hi>My father that gave me theſe ſheep, is greater than all, and none can take them out of my fathers hand:</hi> and on this Pillar St. <hi>Paul</hi> built his hope of Salvation; <hi>He is able to keep that I have committed to him:</hi> he is able to keep my <hi>depoſitum,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12.</p>
            <p>4. The fourth Pillar is the Interceſſion of Chriſt:
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:45614:116"/>and his interceſſion is a prevailing interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt thoſe that come to God by him, ſeeing he ever lives to make interceſſion for them.</hi> Whence was it that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> though he fell fearfully, yet he did not fall final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? becauſe our Saviour prayed for <hi>Peter, I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not,</hi> Luke 22.31. But mark, though this be true, That ſaving grace once wrought in the heart cannot be loſt, for it is built on theſe four immutable Pillars: the Love of God, the Covenant of Grace, the Power of God, and the interceſſion of Chriſt; yet it is poſſible for a man in the ſtate of grace to have his declinings (as I ſhewed you not long ago), he may have his declinings in regard of the meaſure of grace, and the comfortable feeling of grace, and in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and vigour of his grace.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A child of God may loſe the former heat and fervency that he had. The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> fell from her <hi>firſt love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He may loſe the comfortable feeling of Grace: <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Reſtore to me the joy of thy ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Grace may be as a ſpark of fire covered over with a heap of aſhes, that yields neither light nor heat, and ſo he may loſe the vigour of his grace; therefore Chriſtians ſhould take heed of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinings, and ſhould hold faſt the grace they have received.</p>
            <p>Now to make ſome Application.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of Reproof: How juſtly taxable and reprovable are they that do not hold faſt the grace they have received, but fall from their <hi>firſt love?</hi> Oh, how many back-ſliders are there, many that did begin well, but they are weary of well-doing!
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:45614:117"/>the Lord awaken them out of their drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; know you not it will be bitterneſs in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end? will you loſe all you have, and all you hope for? God forbid.</p>
            <p>Therefore to cloſe up this Point with a word of Exhortation:</p>
            <p>I beſeech and exhort you, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, That you will hold faſt the grace you have received, the ſavour of Religion that you have got, the principles of Religion, and the practice of a holy Converſation; hold faſt theſe. Take heed of Apoſtacy, as you love your God, as you love your Souls, as you tender your own everlaſting Salvation; be not found in the number of thoſe that <hi>draw back to perdition: but be ſtedfaſt and immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>ult.</hi> That you may perſevere and not be weary, Let me give you theſe three or four helps.</p>
            <p>1. Be not content with a notional and traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Faith; for ſuch a Faith will change as the time changes; but labour for a divine, well-grounded, lively, working, effectual Faith, experimental Faith, ſuch as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had: <hi>Now do we believe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>not becauſe thou toldſt us this is the Chriſt, but becauſe we have heard him our ſelves, and we know indeed this is the Chriſt the Saviour of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Be much in Duty; if you would not be weary of well-doing, be much in well-doing; It is a Paradox in other things, to ſay, He that would not be weary of running, let him run the more; and if you would be weary of working, work the more: I, but here in Divinity it is a truth; the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:45614:117"/>more you are doing, the better you will be able to do: be acting grace, and in the acting of it, your grace will be encreaſed: grace acted, intends the habit; and the habit intended, does encreaſe ſtrength; therefore up and be doing, and God ſhall be with you.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Walk in the ſpirit, and then you ſhall not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the luſts of the fleſh:</hi> if the Spirit of God help you, <hi>you ſhall run and not be weary; walk, and not faint,</hi> Iſa. 40. <hi>ult.</hi> Remember what I have told you, It is not the ſtrength of habitual grace, but it is the auxiliary, the aſſiſting-grace of the Spirit that carries you through every duty: Though you do duty, yet the Spirit of Chriſt is the moving and working-cauſe; <hi>for without him you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Set before you the example of the Saints, that is another help to perſeverance: it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he held out, though he met with temptations on the right hand and on the left, he held out; why? becauſe he ſaw him that was inviſible, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. So <hi>Job,</hi> Job 23.11, <hi>My feet hath held his path, his way have I kept, and not declined:</hi> So <hi>David, I was almoſt conſumed on earth,</hi> by trouble and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he met with, <hi>yet have I not forgotten thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.87. So <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he knew the Writing was ſealed, and his Religion would coſt him not only his liberty, but his life; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> was <hi>Daniel</hi> ſtill, he went on his courſe as he was wont to do, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. The bleſſed Martyrs that went through impriſonment, bonds, reproaches, perſecution, yet with what courage did they preſs towards the Mark? and ſo with courage they held out to the end, and in the end.</p>
            <p>5. Be often meditating on the rich and royal
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:45614:118"/>Reward, thoſe rich and glorious hopes laid up for thoſe that perſevere; this, if any thing will bear up your hearts and hopes when they are ready to faint: What made the Apoſtle hold out in the midſt of all temptations? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, <hi>For this cauſe we faint not;</hi> Why? <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>our light afflictions which are but for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>Moſes</hi> he held out, <hi>chuſing rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon;</hi> Why? <hi>he had an eye to the recompence of reward,</hi> Heb. 11.26.</p>
            <p>A Traveller after a long journey, when he is weary and faint, and ſits down, if he ſee the Town before him, it puts life into him, and he plucks up his feet, and reſolves not to be weary till he be at his journeys end. O look at the Crown and white Robe ſet before you, and faint if you can: get on the top of Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> look on the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, thoſe good things ſet before you: taſte the grapes of <hi>Canaan</hi> before you come to <hi>Canaan.</hi> Conſider two things: from what you are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to what you are appointed: You are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from wrath, and appointed to mercy; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from Hell, and appointed to Heaven; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from a hopeleſs condition, to a moſt hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and happy condition, that the heart can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or tongue expreſs. If theſe things were ſoundly digeſted, and ſeriouſly conſidered, they would awaken your drooping drowſie ſpirits, and ſet the wheels a going, and make us redouble our endeavour, and encreaſe our diligence, that the Kingdom of Heaven might even ſuffer violence; yea, theſe things will conſtrain us in the midſt of all afflictions, temptations, and tryals, to preſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:45614:118"/>the Mark: therefore <hi>awake thou that ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a ſleep of drowſineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11, <hi>For,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>your ſalvation is nearer than when you believed.</hi> A ſtone, the nearer it comes to the Center, the ſwifter the motion will be: Redeem and recover loſt time by double dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: ſet on Heaven by a new reſolution; ſet thy face towards <hi>Sion,</hi> as one that looks on all theſe creature-comforts as vaniſhing into ſmoak, and as one that reſolves to have Heaven or nothing: do much, and ſuffer much, thou wilt never repent; <hi>Be ſtedfaſt and unmovable, abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſet home this Exhortation of holding faſt what you have received, there are two Motives in the Text which I will diſpatch with a quick hand.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Behold, I come quickly;</hi> What coming does our Saviour here ſpeak of? I Anſwer, This coming of our Saviour may be underſtood three ways: He comes either in a way of Tryal, or in a way of Mercy, or in a way of Judicature. He comes in a way of Tryal, ſo he foretels the heavy temptations and perſecutions that came upon his Church in the time of <hi>Trajanus</hi> the Emperor, as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> well obſerves: This laſted fourteen years, yet our Saviour calls it but <hi>an hour of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Likewiſe <hi>Strabo</hi> the Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, writes, That the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was often ſhaken with Earth-quakes, both ſhe and other Cities were ſhaken with Political Earth-quakes, as well as Natural: with Adverſaries that ſought their ruine. Hence you may take this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:45614:119"/>
               <q>That God hath ſore and ſhaking Tryals to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Church withal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Through many Afflictions we muſt enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; And they that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution,</hi> In one kind or other, in one meaſure or other. God ſees ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is needful to awaken us; to ſhake us out of our ſecurity, and to purifie, and reform, and refine us: therefore let us not ſettle upon our Lees, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe our ſelves ſecurity from Tryals. The hand of God hath been heavy upon the Proteſtant Churches in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in <hi>Poland;</hi> Oh, the dreadful things that they have ſuffered! Why ſhould we expect exemption? are we better than they? Be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned, that you may be fore-armed: lay in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion againſt the day of Tryal: lay in a ſtock of Faith, and Patience, and Self-denial, &amp;c. <hi>Gird on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be underſtood in a way of mercy; I come quickly in a way of mercy: I come to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the tryals, and to deliver thee from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. God will not ſuffer the Rod of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lie on the back of his righteous ſervants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. So then the Doctrine is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> The troubles and tryals of Gods Church and Choſen, though they may be ſharp, yet they ſhall be but ſhort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I come quickly,</hi> I come to deliver my Church quickly; <hi>Nero's</hi> Tribulation was but for ten days, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10, <hi>For a ſmall moment have I forſaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee; in a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <head>Application.</head>
               <p>Therefore it ſerves exceedingly for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the godly, our afflictions are but for a moment: do but ſet againſt your preſent Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the glory that it brings after, and againſt light afflictions, a weight of glory; and againſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary affliction eternal glory; and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon is there between them? none at all: but,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>I come quickly,</hi> It may be taken in a way of Judicature; I come to call men to account, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to every man according to their works: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee that you hold faſt what you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and continue conſtant to the end, and you ſhall be ſure to receive a rich and Royal Reward. <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every one according as his works ſhall be,</hi> Rev. 22.12. Heb. 10.37, <hi>Yet a little while, and he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarry: Be patient therefore, brethren, ſtabliſh your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draws nigh,</hi> Jam. 5.8.</p>
               <p>But here it may be objected, Our Saviour ſpake this above ſixteen hundred years ago, <hi>The coming of the Lord draws nigh,</hi> And yet he is not come to Judgment. To this I Anſwer, A thouſand years in Gods account, is but as one day: we count mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments long, becauſe we are but poor ſhort ſpirited creatures; But God that is of an eternal durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he counts a thouſand years but a very ſmall moment; all that ſpace of time ſhould be ſmall to them that know the greatneſs of Eternity; Do but think of Eternity, and alas, a thouſand of years are but as a moment. But obſerve here, when our Saviour ſpeaks of coming to Judgment, he fixeth a Behold before it: <hi>Behold I come quickly;</hi> it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us this Doctrine,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:45614:120"/>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſts coming to judgment is a matter of infinite concernment, and requires our moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration.</p>
               <p>Behold, Conſider what I ſay, <hi>I am coming to judgment;</hi> There will therefore be a day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is certain: this is called <hi>the great day</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 6, of the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Jude,</hi> and in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8, <hi>That day,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by way of eminency; and it is called <hi>a day of Judgment,</hi> becauſe then every one ſhall receive a final ſentence, either of abſolution or condemnation: But why is this a matter of ſo great concernment? I anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Eternity depends upon it: it will be a final determination to every ſoul, to an everlaſting and unchangeable condition of endleſs bliſs or wo; O this Eternity! it ſwallows up all our thoughts: if it were ſeriouſly conſidered, it were enough to make the moſt prophane and profligate ſinner to turn the ſtricteſt Saint that ever trod upon earth: Therefore to make ſome Uſe of this.</p>
               <p>Live in a continual expectation of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But ſome will ſay, This day of Judgment cannot be ſo ſudden, for the <hi>Jews</hi> are not yet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and Antichriſt is not yet come down. I anſwer, and O that this Anſwer might ſink into your hearts: Though the world ſhould continue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, yet there is a particular Judgment as well as a general: every mans deaths-day, is every mans dooms-day: <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die, and after that the judgment.</hi> As ſoon as the Soul departs out of the body, then it is judged: the Soul is judged then, either to Heaven or Hell; therefore thy day of death will be the Judgment-day to thee, when ever it falls, though it falls this week before the next. Oh that you and I could be
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:45614:120"/>affected as <hi>Jerom</hi> was, Whether I eat or drink, or whatever I do, methinks I hear the Trumpet ſound in my ears, Ariſe ye dead and come to Judgment. Therefore let your whole lives be a continual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for that great day; get thoſe graces that may preſent you without ſpot or blot before Gods Tribunal. Get,</p>
               <p>1. The precious grace of Faith, for that puts on the Royal Robe of Chriſts righteouſneſs; and in that Robe you will ſtand undaunted.</p>
               <p>2. Get Repentance from dead works, be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying your ſelves more and more, as he is pure; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the day of refreſhing ſhall come,</hi> Act. 3.19.</p>
               <p>3. Get a Chriſtian and conſtant care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in your general and particular callings: <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man whom his Lord ſhall find ſo doing.</hi> This is the firſt Motive drawn from the ſuddenneſs of our Saviours coming: <hi>I come quickly.</hi> Another Motive (and of that a few words, and I have done) <hi>That no man take thy Crown.</hi> The danger of loſing the Crown: But here it may be demanded, What is meant by Crown? I anſwer, Either the Crown of Goſpel-Miniſtry, or elſe the Crown of eternal Life. Firſt, God honoured this Church with a very glorious Miniſtry, ſo that the very Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, the ſeeming <hi>Jews</hi> did worſhip, that is, did ſubmit themſelves to this Church, and acknowledg Her to be beloved of God; God honoured this Church with a very glorious Miniſtry. Then it may be meant of the Crown of life: as Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> well obſerves upon the Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10, <hi>I will give thee a Crown of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here it may be demanded, Can the Crown
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:45614:121"/>of Life be loſt? To this I Anſwer:</p>
               <p>In the viſible Church there are Hypocrites as well as ſincere Chriſtians: Now Hypocrites may loſe the Crown, becauſe they never had a title to it, they never had a title to the Crown of Glory; a man muſt have an intereſt in grace, before he can have a title to the Crown of glory: For others that have grace begun in their hearts, you muſt know ſuch cautions as theſe are, are to quicken them: 2 <hi>John</hi> 8, <hi>Look well to your ſelves, that we loſe not thoſe things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward,</hi> Heb. 12.15, <hi>Beware, leſt any of you fall ſhort of the grace of God:</hi> Or it may be ſuch cautions are put in to let you ſee, that if you are left to your ſelves, you would let go grace, and loſe glory and all.</p>
               <p>To ſhut up all, If a Goſpel-Miniſtry be a Crown, Oh that you and I would learn to prize a Goſpel-Miniſtry more than we have done: it may be God will teach you to know the worth of it by the want of it; hold it faſt; remember, God can give the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to another Nation, that may be will bring forth better fruit than we have done; and when the Goſpel is gone, our glory is gone: then we may ſay, <hi>The Glory, the Glory</hi> is departed from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there be a Crown of glory laid up for them that do hold out, then receive that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Text I opened in many Sermons, on <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, <hi>Let us therefore fear leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it;</hi> Therefore take hold of God by Faith: Be much in prayer, be much in wreſtling with God; be much in treaſuring up grace againſt the day of glory, as wicked men treaſure up wrath
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:45614:121"/>againſt the day of wrath. Study to be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, not only with the principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but with the power of godlineſs. Get more Communion with Chriſt, and influence of grace from him, get more conformity to him; O mind this buſineſs of Eternity, of getting this Crown that is laid up for thoſe that hold out and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. I conclude this Text with that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the laſt Sermons which I gave you out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, <hi>Let us therefore fear, leſt a Promiſe being left us of entring into his Reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it;</hi> I ſhewed you, what a dreadful, invaluable, unconceivable and irrecoverable loſs it was to come ſhort of that eternal Reſt that God hath prepared for the Saints in Light. In loſing of Heaven you ſhall loſe the preſence of God, <hi>in whoſe preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for evermore:</hi> In loſing of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, you ſhall loſe the favour of God; never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to enjoy a ſmile of his Face, never, to lie under the hope of one drop of mercy: In loſing Heaven,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:45614:122"/>you ſhall loſe fellowſhip and communion with God, that eternal happineſs which is the portion of the Saints: ſuch an invaluable loſs, that Eternity it ſelf will be little enough to deplore it and bewail it.</p>
            <p>My Deſign in the choice of this Text, is, to ſhew you from it, what one main cauſe is why men come ſhort of that eternal happineſs: namely, their deſpiſing and undervaluing thoſe glorious hopes that are laid up in Heaven: as the deſpiſing the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was the main reaſon why ſo many thouſands of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were excluded from the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as the Text here tells you: <hi>Yea, they deſpiſed the pleaſant Land, they believed not his Word.</hi> Many were the provoking-ſins that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtood guilty of, after that the Lord had wrought that glorious delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for them, in bringing them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> reckons up a whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of them in this excellent <hi>Pſalm</hi> wherein my Text lies: As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Their Rebellion at the Red ſea, in the 7 <hi>verſe, Our Fathers underſtood not thy Wonders in Egypt, they remembred not the multitude of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: but provoked him at the Sea, even at the red Sea,</hi> where God had wrought that glorious deliverance for them; for you know they were ready to diſtruſt the Power of God, and they murmured againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> the Servant of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.11, <hi>And they ſaid unto Moſes, Becauſe there were no Graves in Egypt, haſt thou taken us away to die in the Wilderneſs? Wherefore haſt thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Another ſin was their murmuring for want of fleſh, in the 14 <hi>ver.</hi> of this <hi>Pſalm, But luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:45614:123"/>exceedingly,</hi> or they luſted with a very great luſt: Nothing but fleſh forſooth, would ſerve their turn; they would not be contented with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion that God made for them, of <hi>Manna,</hi> which was Angels Food, which was called <hi>Angels food,</hi> becauſe that if ſo be the glorious Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould want bread for their entertainment and proviſion, if they ſtood in need of bread, they could not have better bread than that which God fed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with from Heaven, every day: but this would not content them, they murmured, and luſted exceedingly after fleſh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another ſin was their Sedition, and their Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and againſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> in the 16 <hi>verſe, They envyed Moſes alſo in the Camp, and Aaron the Saint of the Lord; You take too much upon you, you ſons of Levi: why ſhould you be more holy than we? are not all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holy?</hi> This was a horrible provocation, that made the Lord to cauſe the earth to open and ſwallow up <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth ſin they were guilty of, was their deſpiſing or undervaluing the pleaſant Land that God gave them, in the words of the Text: <hi>Yea, they deſpiſed the Pleaſant Land, they believed not his Word.</hi> So then, in the Text you may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of theſe two Particulars:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, <hi>Iſraels</hi> horrible ingratitude, in this Phraſe, <hi>They deſpiſed the Pleaſant Land.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, The ground of that Ingratitude, in theſe words, <hi>They believed not his Word:</hi> For the firſt,</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Iſraels</hi> horrible Ingratitude, <hi>They deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Pleaſant Land.</hi> By a pleaſant Land here, is meant the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that Land of Promiſe,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:45614:123"/>that God had promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> four hundred and thirty years before ever they did enjoy it, and it is called in the Hebrew, <hi>a Land of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,</hi> or <hi>a deſirable Land;</hi> as dainty food is called <hi>Meat of Deſires</hi> (Job 33.20.) in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew: <hi>So that his Life abhorreth bread, and his Soul dainty meat,</hi> or meat of Deſires. This ſame dainty Land, this ſame deſirable Land, this ſame pleaſant Land, this Land of Promiſe, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, they rejected, they contemptuouſly ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo the Original word properly ſignifies. Now conſider this Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> here, which they deſpiſed, in a two-fold Notion:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, As it was an earthly Poſſeſſion.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, As it was a Type, or Pledg, or Earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt-penny of that heavenly Inheritance laid up for the Saints in Light: And you ſhall ſee in both theſe reſpects, their deſpiſing this Land was hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Ingratitude.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider it in the firſt Notion: namely, as it was an earthly Poſſeſſion, it was very great Ingratitude. But conſider it in the ſecond Notion: namely, as it was a Pledg and earneſt-penny of the heavenly Inheritance, ſo it was a far greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. Take it in the firſt Notion, for an earthly Poſſeſſion: ſo the Doctrine you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from thence, is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That deſpiſing or undervaluing of thoſe outward bleſſings and favours that God beſtows upon a people, is a God-provoking ſin, a ſin of great Ingratitude.</p>
            <p>This you ſee was the ſin of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after they came out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to deſpiſe any Land that God ſhould beſtow upon them: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially conſidering that they had been bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:45614:124"/>in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they that had undergone ſuch a baſe ſervitude, that they had undergone-ſuch burthens of Tyranny, for God to bring them out of ſuch a condition, into a Land, this had been a great mercy; but to bring them into ſuch a Land, a Land flowing with Milk and Honey, to bring them into a Land ſo deſirable: This certainly was a grievous provocation, eſpecially if you conſider what Land this was; for,</p>
            <p>Firſt, It was very delightful in regard of the Scituation of it; <hi>Canaan</hi> being ſcituated (as Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers obſerve) in the midſt or Center of the whole Earth: for it had <hi>Aſia</hi> upon the Eaſt, and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> upon the Weſt, and <hi>Africa</hi> upon the South, and <hi>America,</hi> and <hi>Scythia,</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> upon the North; it was very pleaſant therefore in the ſcituation of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It was pleaſant in regard of the Air; though it is true, it was a hotter Climate than ours is, yet it was a very temperate Climate; it was a Climate of that temper, that they were free from all noiſome vapours: ſo it was a healthful Land in that regard.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It was a very fruitful Land; a Land that did abound with Corn, and Cattel, and Vines, and Fig-trees, and Pomgranates, as you may find <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.7, 8, 9, <hi>For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good Land; a Land of Brooks of waters of Fountains, and depths that ſpring out of valley, and hills: a Land of Wheat, and Barley, and Vines, and Fig-trees, and Pomgranates: a Land of Oyl, Olives and Honey; A Land wherein thou ſhalt eat bread without ſcarceneſs, thou ſhalt not lack any thing in it: a Land whoſe ſtones are iron, and out of whoſe Hills thou mayſt dig braſs.</hi> It's a Land, ſaith the Lord, wherein thou ſhalt not lack any thing, any
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:45614:124"/>thing that may be deſirable, any thing that may be comfortable for their ſubſiſtence: for them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deſpiſe ſuch a Land as this was, it could not but provoke the Lord to anger. You know there is no juſter provocation among men, than kindneſs churliſhly refuſed. Now for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpife this Land, a free gift, a gift of bounty and favour, ſuch a gift as they could not in the leaſt merit at the hand of God; you find God himſelf beating them off from that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.4, <hi>Speak not then in thine heart, after the Lord thy God hath caſt them out before thee, ſaying, for my righteouſneſs the Lord hath brought me in to poſſeſs this Land.</hi> It was not for thy righteouſneſs-ſake, but it was for his own Name-ſake, and his Promiſe-ſake, that he made to <hi>Abraham</hi> for them to poſſeſs this Land; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a gift of favour, and free bounty, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and it was a very great ſin, becauſe ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is hateful both to God and man. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> (as one calls it) <hi>is the helliſh bar or ſtop to all future mercies.</hi> A man that is about to pour in ſome precious Oyl or Liquor into a Glaſs, if he ſee the Glaſs be crack'd, or there be a hole in it, you know he will pour in no Oyl or Liquor in that Glaſs: So here, an unthankful man is a broken Glafs, and God will not beſtow his favours upon thoſe that are unthankful, at leaſt he will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them in mercy; he ſometimes gives theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings in anger, <hi>I gave thee a King in mine anger,</hi> Hoſ. 13.11, but he never gives mercies in love and favour to unthankful wretches. This ſin of unthankfulneſs ſometimes provokes the Lord to ſtrain for his Rent, when men will not give him the quit-Rent of thankfulneſs. Therefore ſays God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8, 9, <hi>Becauſe ſhe did not know that I
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:45614:125"/>gave her Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, and multiplyed her ſilver and gold, which was prepared for Baal; therefore will I return and take away my Corn in the time thereof, and my Wine in the ſeaſon thereof, and will recover my Wool and my Flax, given to cover her nakedneſs:</hi> ſays God, <hi>I will ſtrip her naked, and leave her bare.</hi> Unthankfulneſs provokes the Lord you ſee, to take away all his mercies, and to ſtrain for his Rent: but that is not all, for it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the Lord to inflict ſome ſpiritual judgment, when men are unthankful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, and 24 <hi>verſes,</hi> compared together: it's ſaid, <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and their fooliſh hearts were darkned. Wherefore God alſo gave them up to uncleanneſs through the luſts of their own hearts, to diſhonour their own bodies between themſelves.</hi> So that you ſee, deſpiſing or undervaluing thoſe outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings or mercies that God beſtows upon a People, is a God-provoking ſin, a ſin of ingratitude.</p>
            <p>Let me briefly apply this; for this is not the Point I intend principally to handle, but only to touch at it:</p>
            <p>I beſeech you my Brethren, Let every one of us enter into our own hearts, and by ſome ſerious, ſelf-reflecting thoughts, call our ſelves to an account, whether we be not in the number of thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and undervalue thoſe National mercies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath enrich'd us. We live in a pleaſant Land, in a <hi>Goſhen</hi> for light, in a <hi>Canaan</hi> for plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: We live here in a City that is lifted up to Heaven in Mercies, in the uſe of Ordinances: I believe there is not ſuch a place under the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of God, not ſuch a City that hath ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:45614:125"/>proviſions both for Soul and Body, as we have; But, have we walked worthy of the Lord unto all well-pleaſing? Have we liv'd up to our light, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our means, under our mercies? Have we thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prized and improved theſe National privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and bleſſings that we enjoy? No, no, God knows, and our own hearts know, that it is not ſo. Alas, it may be ſaid of theſe Nations, as it was ſaid of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Ezra 9.11, <hi>The Land to which ye go to poſſeſs it, it is an unclean Land, with the filthineſs of the People of the Lands, with their abominations which have filled it, from one end to another with their uncleanneſs.</hi> So may it be ſaid of this pleaſant Land; this goodly Land, this goodly City that we live in; it is an unclean City, through the filthineſs and abomination of many that live therein: and therefore that which God threatens, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.25, <hi>And the Land it ſelf vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth out her Inhabitants:</hi> even ſo juſtly might our God deal with us, becauſe we have defiled the Land with our abominations and uncleanneſs; therefore the Land ſhould ſpew us out. We have ſwallowed down his mercies without regarding him that beſtowed thoſe mercies upon us: juſt like the Hog under the Acorn-tree that ſwallows down the Maſt, but does not look unto the Tree. We have been a murmuring and diſcontented people, ſo looking upon one croſs, as to forget a thouſand mercies: We have no way walked worthy of all the good things that our God hath given us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy: therefore it were juſt that God ſhould deal with us as he threatens, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47, 48, <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the Lord thy God with joyfulneſs, and with gladneſs of heart for the abundance of all things: therefore ſhalt thou ſerve thine enemy which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:45614:126"/>the Lord ſhall ſend againſt thee in hunger, and in thirſt, and in nakedneſs, and in want of all things: and he ſhall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have deſtroyed thee,</hi> &amp;c. Our unthankfulneſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, the Lord awaken us to repentance: but I will not inſiſt longer upon that Point.</p>
            <p>I eome therefore to the ſecond Notion: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as it was a Type, or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, or Pledg, or Earneſt-penny of that ſame Heavenly Inheritance that God hath laid up for the <hi>Saints in Light;</hi> and ſo their ingratitude was far greater; <hi>they deſpiſed that pleaſant Land,</hi> this was a grievous provocation indeed; ſo the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I ſhall give you from the words, conſidered in this notion or ſenſe, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That deſpiſing, or undervaluing that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance that God hath prepared for the Saints in light, is a very grievous God-provoking ſin: it is a ſin of the firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>For the proof of this Point, that one place of Scriptue will be ſufficient, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2, 3, <hi>For if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every transgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward: how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation: which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him? How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> By <hi>Salvation</hi> there, he means the Goſpel, which is the cauſe of our Salvation: for it is obſervable, that both the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Grace, and Grace wrought by the Goſpel, and Glory, which is the perfection of Grace, they all come under one name: <hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:45614:126"/>in Scripture; becauſe thoſe whom God by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel brings to Grace, he will by Grace bring to Glory; now, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>How ſhall we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> It is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous ſtrong Negation: he does not ſay, <hi>We ſhall not eſcape,</hi> or <hi>hardly eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation;</hi> but, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape?</hi> It includes the ſtrongeſt Negation that can be; as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>It is impoſſible for us to eſcape eternal Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if we do neglect ſo great Salvation;</hi> not only if we do deſpiſe this eternal Salvation, but if we neglect it. Salvation it ſelf will not ſave that man that deſpiſes or neglects it.</p>
            <p>But for the clearing of this Point, that you may a little better underſtand it: there are theſe three Queries I will endeavour to ſpeak to, in opening of the Doctrine.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, When may a man be ſaid to deſpiſe or undervalue that Heavenly Inheritance that is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Saints in light.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, How comes it to pafs, that men ſo lightly regard, and undervalue that eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</item>
               <item>Thirdly, How may it appear that this deſpiſing or undervaluing of this Heavenly Inheritance, is ſuch a God-provoking ſin?</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, When may a man be ſaid to deſpiſe, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the Heavenly Inheritance that is <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Saints in light?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall anſwer this Query, and ſhew it you in theſe four Particulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Then doth a man deſpiſe and undervalue this Heavenly Inheritance, when he is an Earthly-minded man: when he does over-value earthly things, and under-value Heavenly things: when
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:45614:127"/>he does ſet his affections ſo much on things below, that he cannot ſet his affections on things above: for theſe two are inconſiſtent, they cannot ſtand together, as appears by that in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15, <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world: If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>The love of God, and the love of the world, are inconſiſtent.</hi> So, in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.2, <hi>Set your affections on things above, and not on things on the Earth:</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>If you ſet your affections on things below, you cannot ſet them on things above.</hi> Now when a man prefers a preſent poſſeſſion, before a future expectation: when he ſays, Give me a Bird in hand, rather than two in the Buſh: give me the pleaſures and profits, and honours, and contentments of this life, let me have prefent pay: but as for that glorious Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance you ſpeak of, for the time to come, let them look after it that will; as he ſaid, <hi>Let me have my part in</hi> Paris, <hi>let who will look after a part in</hi> Paradice. This is an undervaluing of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Then may a man be ſaid to deſpiſe and undervalue this Heavenly Inheritance, when he is ſluggiſh and ſloathful, and will not ſtir up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to take hold of God: when he will not ſet about thoſe means that God hath appointed for the attaining of thoſe glorious hopes that are laid up in Heeven. True, nothing is to be done by us in a way of merit; but much is to be done in the uſe of means for the attaining of this Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12,) <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling:</hi> Mark, it is not ſaid, <hi>Work out your ſalvation;</hi> Chriſt hath wrought out our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for us by way of merit, but we muſt work
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:45614:127"/>out our ſalvation in the uſe of means: Orig, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Work it out, as it were out of the fire. Now when a man will not be contented to take that pains that the Lord requires, in this working out of his ſalvation; when he ſits ſtill and is idle, or when he is ſloathful or negligent in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: when he does either neglect Duty, or ſleepily and careleſly perform every Duty, this is a deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and undervaluing this Salvation. For you muſt know, the Kingdom of Heaven is compared to a <hi>Race,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.24: and he that would win the Crown by firſt coming to the Goal, muſt run for it. It is compared to a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> Luke 13.24, and he that would win it, muſt ſtrive for it; <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Strive as in an Agony. And it's compared to a <hi>Crown,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.25: and he that would obtain it, muſt fight for it; <hi>I have fought a good fight</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the Faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judg ſhall give me at that day,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. The Crown of Glory there, is called <hi>a Crown of Righteouſneſs;</hi> not becauſe it was merited by <hi>Pauls</hi> righteouſneſs, you muſt not underſtand it ſo; but it is called <hi>a Crown of Righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe it was promiſed, and becauſe it was purchaſed; it was freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the Father, and it was fully purchaſed by the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt: ſays he, <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which the Lord the Righteous Judg ſhall give me at that day.</hi> But ſays he, <hi>I have fought a good fight</hi> firſt, <hi>and I have finiſhed my courſe.</hi> Now, when men will neither ſo run as that they may obtain, nor ſo ſtrive as that they may gain a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:45614:128"/>nor ſo fight that they may get a Crown that is laid up in Heaven for the Saints: then they may be ſaid to deſpiſe and undervalue the Heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. That is the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Then may a man be ſaid to deſpiſe this Heavenly Inheritance, when he is a ſelf-ſeeking Chriſtian, or rather a pelting Chapman (as I may ſo call him) that will not come up to the price of Salvation, that will not be contented to take the pains that muſt be taken; if ſo be he may be the maſter of his own deſires, then he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to enjoy thoſe glorious hopes. But when a man will not with the wiſe Merchant, ſell all, that he may buy the Pearl; for as Jeſus Chriſt may be called <hi>A Pearl of Price,</hi> ſo may this Heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance be called <hi>A Pearl;</hi> though not of that price that Jeſus Chriſt is of, yet a Pearl of price too. Now when men will not part with all, in cafe it come to that point, to get this Pearl, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and undervalue this bleſſed Inheritance. Every man would be contented to come to Heaven, ſo he might come in his own way, on his own terms, and in his own time. If he may come to Heaven in his own way, that is Heaven and the World, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and his luſts, Heaven and his own ends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts together: Or if he may have Heaven upon his own terms: namely, to live as he liſt, to take Jeſus Chriſt as a Saviour, but not as a Prince; to take him as a Redeemer, but not as a Ruler: Or if he may have Heaven in his own time; namely, when he lies upon his Death-bed, when his ſick Bed is ready to deliver him over to his cold Grave; but all his life long he would proſecute his own ends, and intereſt, and live to himſelf more than to Jeſus Chriſt; every man on Earth would be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:45614:128"/>contented to have Heaven on theſe terms. But now, when it comes to this, that a man that will have this Heavenly Inheritance, muſt have it in Chriſts way, in a way of Holineſs: <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.16. <hi>And without holineſs none ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. And when it comes to this, that if a man will have Heaven, he muſt have it on Chriſts own terms: which is, that thou muſt be contented to ſerve me, as well as to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by me; and to be contented to be ruled by me, as well as to be redeemed by me; thou muſt be contented to bear my Croſs, as well as to wear my Crown. And when it comes to this, that a man muſt have Heaven in Chriſts own time, what time is that? <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,</hi> Heb. 3.7. Put not off your repentance from day to day: ſet about the work with all your might; ſet about it without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther procraſtination, or delay. Now here it ſticks: rather than men will have Heaven on theſe terms, they reſolve they will never have Heaven, they will let it go.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Then men may be accounted, or ſaid to deſpiſe Heaven, when Heaven is not accounted worthy thoſe difficulties or diſcouragements that they muſt fuſtain in the purſuit of thoſe glorious hopes. Thus with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when the Spies came from <hi>Canaan,</hi> and told them; True, the Land is an excellent Land; but let's tell you, there are Giants, <hi>Anakims,</hi> walled Towns, there will be a great deal of difficulty before you get poſſeſſion; and if you will poſſeſs the Land, you muſt fight for it, it will coſt you the lives of many of you, before you obtain it. Oh now, upon this report they were ready to ſtone <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> thoſe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:45614:129"/>two that told them, that they were able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Inhabitants: and that they were but as bread for them, and their ſtrength was departed; they were ready (I ſay) to ſtone them, when they heard of the difficulties of obtaining the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they would rather go back again into <hi>Egypt,</hi> than fight for <hi>Canaan;</hi> we will rather go back to our Leeks, and Onions, and Garlick, than have this pleaſant Land, if we muſt fight and adventure our lives for it. So here, when faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted cowardly Chriſtians hear, <hi>that through much tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 14.22: <hi>Yea, and all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.12. And when they hear that truth which our Saviour tells them, <hi>Mark</hi> 8 34, <hi>If you will be my Diſciples, you muſt take up your Croſs and follow me:</hi> As good Soldiers that follow their Captain, through dirt, and mire, and blood. And that they muſt be hated of all men for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.22. And that they muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure hardſhip in the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. Though their ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy: Say they, If we cannot have Heaven but upon theſe terms, we will have none of it, we will rather have the pleaſure of ſin for a ſeaſon; we will lye, and ſwear, and cozen, and cog, and flatter, and temporize, and ſwim with every ſtream, and loſe the peace of our Conſciences; we will rather chuſe to ſleep in a whole skin, though with gauled Conſciences: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will have Heaven upon ſuch terms, we will have our eaſe, we cannot abide difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, which are in the way that leads to Heaven; this is a deſpiſing of the pleaſant Land. That is the firſt Query, When may a man be ſaid
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:45614:129"/>to deſpiſe this heavenly Inheritance. But in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For Explication. How comes it to paſs, that men are ſo ready to deſpiſe and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value ſuch a glorious Inheritance, <hi>an Inheritance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, and undefiled, that fadeth not away, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the heavens,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. <hi>A Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken,</hi> Heb. 12.28? To deſpiſe thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and unconceivable <hi>joys that are at the right hand of God for evermore?</hi> Pſalm 16.11. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a man would wonder that any, unleſs they were bereav'd of their reaſon, unleſs they had loſt their ſenſes &amp; feeling, that ever any man ſhould part with ſuch glorious hopes, hopes of ſuch a glorious Inheritance, that ſurpaſſes what eye hath ſeen, or ear heard, or whatever the heart of man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. But I will tell you the reaſon; the Reaſons briefly are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Men deſpiſe this glorious Inheritance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not the worth of it, <hi>John</hi> 4.10, <hi>Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith unto thee, give me to drink; thou wouldſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</hi> So, if men did but know what this heavenly Inheritance is, Oh were they but with <hi>Moſes</hi> (Deut. 32.49.) to ſtand upon Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> to ſee this Land afar off, to ſee but a glimpſe of it: Or if they were with <hi>Paul</hi> (2 Cor. 12.) wrapt up into Heaven one day, nay, but a few hours, they would adventure to get through the narrow Wicker, the narrow Dore, though an Angel with a drawn Sword kept the paſſage, as you read, an Angel did keep the Gate of Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.24. If a man ſaw but one glimpſe of that eternal glory, he would cry
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:45614:130"/>out as that Father, <hi>Dominus hic affligas, hic corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas, corpus maximis doloribus afficias,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>modo in eternum parcas.</hi> Oh Lord, Cut me here, wound me here, burn me here, let all the pains of Hell come upon my body, ſo my poor Soul may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſo I may come to that eternal Inheritance. But men are ignorant, and know not the worth of it, therefore they do not prize it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Men undervalue this heavenly Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, becauſe they were never yet ſufficiently humbled for their ſins, they never had Soul-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king humiliation and conviction upon their Spirits: they never yet feelingly groaned under the burden of ſin: they never taſted the bitterneſs of ſin, they never yet conſidered the woful wages of ſin. But if God now ſhould but take ſuch a one by the neck, as he did <hi>Job, and ſhake him to pieces, and ſet him up for a mark, and his Archers ſhould compaſs him round about, and cleave his Reins aſunder, and not ſpare him: and pour out his Gaul upon the ground, and break him with breach upon breach, and run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him like a Giant,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> complains, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14: Oh, Chriſt now would be Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Heaven now would be Heaven indeed; ſuch a one would ſay, Oh Lord, Do with me what thou pleaſeſt, ſo I may be but thine. But becauſe men were never yet throughly humbled, therefore they never prize this glorious Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe men are bewitched with the pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon; and why are they bewitched with them? becauſe of the preſent enjoyment of them. <hi>Demas hath for ſaken me, having loved this preſent world</hi> (2 Tim. 4.10); and he loved it, becauſe it was preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:45614:130"/>Fourthly, Becauſe men are rockt aſleep in the Cradle of ſecurity, the Devils Cradle: Satan makes them believe Heaven may be got with a wet Finger; and that they may come thither, whatſoever their courſe and converſation be; and that they may put off their repentance to the laſt Year of their lives: nay, to the laſt Month of the laſt Year; nay, to the laſt day of the laſt Month: and that one day is as good as five thouſand, to make their peace with God in; and that it is a ſmall matter to repent, and that a <hi>Lord have mercy upon thee,</hi> will ſerve thy turn to bring thee to Heaven. That's the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Query.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, The third Query is this: But how will it appear, that this deſpiſing and undervaluing this heavenly Inheritance, is ſuch a grievous God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoking ſin? I will tell you, it will appear thus; There are two reaſons I ſhall give you for it:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe this deſpiſing of that heavenly Inheritance, ſpeaks men to be <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> it proves men to be <hi>Atheists,</hi> to look at nothing but at things preſent: that <hi>look upon things that are ſeen,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>look upon things that are not ſeen: Things that are ſeen, are temporal; but things that are not ſeen, are ſpiritual and eternal.</hi> So I ſay, they look only at things preſent: and they meaſure their joy only by outward proſperity, and they meaſure their ſorrow only by the want of it. Now what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing it is for men to be <hi>Atheiſts!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This deſpiſing or undervaluing of the heavenly Inheritance, it provokes the Lord ſo to anger, that he ſware in his wrath, ſuch deſpiſers ſhall never, never taſte of that Inheritance, never enjoy that they have deſpiſed. Thus did God deal with thoſe deſpiſing <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> thoſe ſcornful <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:45614:131"/>in the Wilderneſs, that deſpiſed that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Land. You may read the ſad ſtory, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.28, 29, 30: Says God, being exceedingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to anger; <hi>Say unto them, As truly as I live, ſaith the Lord as you have ſpoken in mine ear, ſo will I do unto you; your carcaſſes ſhall fall in the Wilderneſs, and all that were numbred of you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured againſt me; doubtleſs, ye ſhall not come into the Land, concerning which I ſware to make you dwell therein, ſave Caleb the ſon of Jephunch, and Joſhua the ſon of Nun.</hi> Not one of thoſe thouſands that I brought out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not one of them ſhall ſee the Land they deſpiſed. Juſt ſo will God deal with thoſe that deſpiſe and undervalue this heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. Says the Lord, Have I prepared a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, an Everlaſting Kingdom, a Kingdom of Glory? Have I prepared ſuch things <hi>as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive?</hi> Have I prepared a place of infinite and unſpeakable happineſs, ſuch happineſs as all the Kingdoms of the World, and the beauty, and glory, and ſplendor, and pleaſures of them, are not worthy to be a Picture of it? what, have I provided ſuch a Crown, ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? and do you undervalue it? Do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it? Will you not tread in the way that leads to it? <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, You ſhall never enter into my Reſt, you ſhall never enjoy the Land, nor poſſeſs it.</hi> Thus I have opened the Point to you, and ſhewed you, that deſpiſing or undervaluing that heavenly Inheritance that God hath prepared for the Saints in Light, is a very grievous God provoking ſin. Now briefly to apply it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:45614:131"/>Firſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> by way of Examination. Would it no be a very neceſſary enquiry, a very neeedful enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for you and me, and every one of us, in ſome ſerious ſelf-reflecting thoughts, to call our ſelves to an account, whether we be in the number of thoſe that deſpiſe and undervalue this heavenly Inheritance, yea or no? But it may be you will ſay, <hi>We hope we are not ſuch as deſpiſe, or undervalue this heavenly Inheritance: God forbid we ſhould be ſuch Atheiſts.</hi> But for anſwer, Pray tell me, Art thou one that overvalueſt Earth, and undervalueſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Art thou one that ſayeſt, I am ſo much taken up with the World, ſo over head and ears in the World: I drive a Trade to provide for my Family, but to drive a Trade for Heaven, I have no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, no leiſure; thou that ſayeſt thou haſt no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to look after Heaven, thou wilt have leiſure enough to bewail the loſs of Heaven, when thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years are gone, and ten thouſand to that, and a hundred thouſand to that: all this while thou ſhalt be weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of thy teeth, for the loſs of it. When thou preferreſt a preſent poſſeſſion before a future expectation, do you not deſpiſe Heaven, and undervalue it? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with your own hearts: is it not as I ſpeak? Do I not ſpeak the hearts of ſome of you?</p>
            <p>Again, Are you not ſloathful and ſecure? and do you not neglect thoſe means that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed? Do you work out your Salvation? Do you ſo run that you may obtain? Do you fight the good fight of Faith? Examine your hearts, and ſee if you are not ſecure, and neglectful of the means God hath ordained, for the obtaining of this glorious and heavenly Inheritance. Remember the ſpeech of the Spies, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.9, <hi>For we have
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:45614:132"/>ſeen the Land, and behold it is very good; and are ye ſtill? Be not ſloathful to go, and to enter to poſſeſs the Land.</hi> The Land is an exceeding good Land, all things that can be deſired are there: and do you ſit ſtill? So may I ſay, Here is a pleaſant Land, a glorious Land, a Land flowing with Milk and Honey; here are <hi>pleaſures at Gods right hand for evermore,</hi> and do you ſit ſtill? will you not run? do you not ſtrive to enter?</p>
            <p>Again, You ſay, you do not undervalue Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; I beſeech you conſider, What, are you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with for Heaven? will you ſell all to buy this Pearl? Will you part with any thing that ſtands in oppoſition to your hopes? Will you take Chriſt in his own way, and on his own terms, and in his own time? Can you be content to ſwallow down ſome diſcouragements, and difficulties, and temptations, and bleſs God for them: and ſay, One ſmile of thy face will recompence a thouſand years of adverſity? If I have Chriſt for my porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Heaven in reverſion, though I carry a Rod of affliction at my back every day: though I am fed with the water of affliction, and with the bread of adverſity, Heaven will make amends for all. But alas! How many have weak hands, and feeble knees, and are not able to go on in the way of Salvation, and will not come up to the price of Salvation! Do not deceive your felves. Theſe are plain down-right Truths, bottomed upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if I ſpeak not the truth, believe me not; but if I do, ſome of you have cauſe with ſerious ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, to ſmite upon your Thighs, and you have cauſe greatly to fear this deſpiſing and undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this heavenly Inheritance, is your ſin; and Oh that it might be your ſorrow and ſhame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:45614:132"/>Secondly, This Doctrine may juſtly ſerve for to reprove (and I profeſs, I know no reproof ſharp enough for) ſuch perſons as deſpiſe and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue that heavenly Inheritance that God hath <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Saints in Light.</hi> Let me ſay to ſome of you, as God ſpeaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.41, <hi>Behold ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh.</hi> So ſay I, Hearken ye deſpiſers: hearken ye ſecure, careleſs, ſenſleſs, ſottiſh <hi>Atheiſts</hi> (I can call you no better); Oh, you that have ſuch ſlight thoughts of Heaven, you that look upon this heavenly Inheritance but as imaginary, a Fools Paradiſe, or as a meer conceit, rather than any real exiſtent thing: you that never yet ſet your hearts and ſouls to ſeek the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Kingdom; you whoſe hearts are buried in Earth and Earthly things, who mind nothing but Earth, nothing in the World but raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Eſtates, and ſatisfying the brutiſh part of your ſelves: Tell me, Do you think that ever you ſhall enjoy this external Inheritance which you have deſpiſed? Shall you ever taſte of that everlaſting happineſs which you have ſo much undervalued? Will the Lord caſt Pearls before Swine? Will he hang ſuch a Jewel, ſuch an unvaluable Jewel, which is better worth than ten thouſand Worlds? will be hang ſuch a Jewel on a Swines ſnout? No, no, you deceive your ſelves, if you think ſo. Do you think that Heaven will drop into your mouths as you lie a-dying? Do you think our Saviour ſpeaks in vain, when he ſays, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12, <hi>And from the days of John the Baptiſt, until now, the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi> If Heaven could be purchas'd with a <hi>Lord have mercy upon us:</hi> if it could be procured in ſuch a cold, lazy, luke-warm way as you walk in, then
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:45614:133"/>certainly our bleſſed Saviour did not know what he ſaid; his exhorting to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, was to no purpoſe. But if pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of this Salvation, and ſtriving or this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the end of your lives: if theſe muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enjoying, then as ſure as the Lord lives, you careleſs, ſecure, ſottiſh Sinners, that mind nothing leſs than that one thing neceſſary: aſſure your ſelves, you ſhall never have a portion in that Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance which is <hi>prepared for the Saints in Light;</hi> no, there is another place prepared for ſuch Dogs and Swine (as they are called), that place <hi>without,</hi> Rev. 22.15, <hi>For without are Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murtherers, and Idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lye.</hi> You all cry out of <hi>Eſau</hi> a prophane wretch, the Spirit of God brands him for it, a prophane <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> that ſold his Birth right for a Meſs of Pottage: he ſold his Birth-right, which was a Type of Heaven; he ſold this for an old Song (as we ſay). And you that neglect, and undervalue, and deſpiſe Heaven; you are guilty of the ſame ſin, and have you not as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſpirits as he? You cry out of <hi>Judas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſold his Maſter for thirty pieces of ſilver. Oh hearken, impenitent ſottiſh Sinner! It may be thou ſelleſt Chriſt, and Heaven, and Glory, and all, may be, for a baſe luſt, a baſe lye: thou ſelleſt it for ſome conſiderable advantage, as thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveſt for the preſent, though at laſt it will be like Gravel in the Throat. Take home this reproof with you: the Lord ſet it home upon your Souls, you that never ſet your hearts &amp; ſouls to ſeek the Lord.</p>
            <p>I have done with a word of Exhortation: That is, I beſeech you, and exhort you, in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you would take heed
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:45614:133"/>of this God-provoking, Soul-damning ſin; take heed of undervaluing this heavenly Inheritance: Let it not be ſaid of any of you, that you deſpiſed the pleaſant Land; inſtead of deſpiſing it, do you highly priſe it: and ſay as <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 119.174, <hi>I have longed for thy ſalvation, O Lord, and thy Law is my delight.</hi> And what a kind of longing was it? Not a cold wiſh, ſuch a wiſh as <hi>Balaam</hi> had, <hi>O that I might die the death of the Righteous:</hi> that Heaven might drop into my mouth then, but I would live as I liſt; it was not ſuch a deſire: no, ſays <hi>David, I have longed for thy ſalvation:</hi> what then? <hi>Thy Law is my delight.</hi> That is a right longing that is accompanied with an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; he rightly longs for the Salvation of God, that delights in the Commands of God. In the 123 <hi>ver.</hi> of the ſame <hi>Pſalm, Mine eyes fail in waiting for thy Salvation.</hi> Look as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will never beſtow himſelf upon that Soul that does not pant, and breathe, and break, with longing deſires after him. So likewiſe, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beſtow this heavenly Inheritance upon that Soul that does not moſt earneſtly, wiſhfully, and induſtriouſly pant after him; and long for him, and ſeek him, that you may prize him. Take heed, in the fear of God, of thoſe four cauſes of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing this Salvation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Take heed of Earthly-mindedneſs; beg that you may be digged out of the thick Mire and Clay: ſay, Give me not my portion here, O Lord: How ſad will it be with me, if thou putteſt me off only with theſe outward things!</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take heed of ſloathfulneſs and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs in the ſervice of God, and in ſeeking this Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11, <hi>Not ſloathful in buſineſs,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:45614:134"/>ſèrvent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> Seek the Lord, and ſeek his Salvation, with all your might, mind and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Be content to part with any thing for Chriſt; take heed of placing your love upon the Creature; be content to part with any thing that ſtands in oppoſition to, or in competition with thoſe glorious hopes that are laid up for the Saints in Light.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Be contented to endure ſome hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the way; Heaven will make amends for all: all the coſts, diſcouragements, and difficulties that you meet with in the purſuit of your hopes, will be abundantly recompenced by one hours fruition of that eternal happineſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you would not deſpiſe or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value that heavenly Inheritance, learn to live by Faith, and not by ſight and ſenſe; if you live by ſight and ſenſe, you will look <hi>on the things that are ſeen, and not on the things that are not ſeen: the things that are ſeen are temporal, but the things that are not ſeen, are eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18. If you live by Faith, you will fetch your comforts from Chriſt, more than from any thing in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you would not deſpiſe this pleaſant Land, then beg of Jeſus Chriſt, that he would draw your Souls, that you may run after him. Quicken me with thy quickning-grace, for thy Name ſake; Lord, beſtow thy quickning-grace upon me, that I may mind the buſineſs of Eternity ſeriouſly. Lord, help me to ſet about the work vigorouſly, that I may not trifle with thee in matters that are of infinite Concernment. I remember the ſpeech of a Martyr, a good woman, at that time when
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:45614:134"/>profeſſion of the Goſpel was enough to bring to the ſtake; ſays ſhe, <hi>I hear there are Crowns and Kingdoms to be diſpoſed of this day; here, take my child, I will put in for one Crown, for one Kingdom.</hi> Oh that every one of us had hearts to do as ſhe did; let us be contented to ſuffer hardſhip for a while, that we may enjoy the pleaſant Land for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>So much for the firſt Branch of the Text, that is the horrible ingratitude of this people: <hi>They deſpiſed the pleaſant Land.</hi> The ground of that ingratitude you have in the next words of the Text, <hi>And believed not his Word.</hi> But ſo much for this time.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="sermon">

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Have ſpoken to this Text in one Sermon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, as you may remember; in it I took notice of two Branches:</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Iſraels</hi> horrible ingratitude, in theſe words, <hi>They deſpiſed the pleaſant Land;</hi> and that I finiſhed laſt day.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the ſecond Branch of the Text, that is the ground of their ingratitude, in theſe words, <hi>They believed not his Word.</hi> What word? They believed not the Promiſe that God had made
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45614:135"/>unto them, that he would beſtow the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan upon them;</hi> nay, God did not only promiſe it, but he ſware unto <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 50.24, <hi>And Joſeph ſaid unto his Brethren, I die, and God will ſurely viſit you, and bring you out of this Land, to the Land which he ſware to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, to Iſaac, and Jacob.</hi> But becauſe the Spies forſooth came and told them: Oh, there are wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Cities, and Giants, and <hi>Anakims</hi> to fight with, and it is impoſſible for you to get poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Land; therefore they believed the Spies, but they would not believe God; they believed the report of thoſe that told them of the Giants, but they would not believe Gods Report, they would not believe Gods Promiſe. So the Doctrine I ſhall commend to you from this ſecond Branch of the Text, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> One main Reaſon why men do undervalue the Heavenly Canaan, and ſo come ſhort of it, is their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</p>
            <p>Look as it was with the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> here ſpoken of in the Text; the ſin that made them deſpiſe and undervalue the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo were debar'd and ſhut out of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was their Unbelief: as the Apoſtle ſhews expreſly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. So we ſee they could not enter in, becauſe of unbelief.</hi> So here, One main reaſon why men undervalue the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo come ſhort, or are deprived of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan:</hi> it is their Unbelief. Men believe lyes, but they will not believe the Truth; they believe the Devil, who is a lyar, and tells them they may come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a wet-finger, and therefore they may live as they liſt; but they will not believe the Lord
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:45614:135"/>Jeſus Chriſt, that tells them, <hi>Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth to life, and few there be that find it,</hi> Matth. 7.14. They believe the father of lyes, but they will not believe him that is the God of Truth; who ſays, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for many I ſay unto you, ſhall ſeek to enter in, but ſhall not be able,</hi> Luke 13.24. They believe the report of Satan, but they will not believe the report of the word of God, which tells us expreſly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18, <hi>And if the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and ſinners appear?</hi> They will not believe that Doctrine (which you may remember) proved out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, <hi>Let us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> Where I ſhewed you, that the life of a Chriſtian is a life of fear: and that in matters of Soul-concernment, Chriſtians ſhould not only be very jealous of themſelves, but of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo. I alſo ſhewed you, that it is poſſible for many that are profeſſors of the Truth, or true Religion, to come ſhort of Heaven; and that it is poſſible for many that are confident that they are in a ſtate of grace, to come ſhort of Heaven; and that it is poſſible for many to come very near to Heaven, and yet to come ſhort of Heaven. But men will not believe theſe Truths: now their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief is the cauſe why they ſlight Heaven, and ſhall be deprived of Heaven. For the better Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Doctrine, there are two things I ſhall open to you:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, What this Unbelief is, that makes men ſo undervalue the Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, Why this Unbelief is ſuch a great and grievous ſin, ſo dangerous and deſtructive, that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:45614:136"/>it deprives men of that Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, What this Unbelief is that makes men ſlight the Heavenly <hi>Canaan:</hi> For anſwer to this, you muſt know there is a twofold Unbelief:
<list>
                  <item>There is a Negative</item>
                  <item>And There is a Poſitive</item>
               </list> Unbelief.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a Negative Unbelief; and that is the ſin of <hi>Pagans</hi> and Heathens, that never heard of God, nor of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; they believe not, becauſe they know not: they know not God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, <hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> This is the ſin of <hi>Pagans:</hi> this ignorance it excuſes in part, though not in whole; their ſin is not ſo great by far, as the ſin of thoſe that do profeſs the Goſpel; yet their Negative unbelief is a ſin, becauſe Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is, That we ſhould believe on the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23, <hi>And this is his commandment, that we believe in the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But this is the Negative un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief: this concerns not us, but it concerns thoſe <hi>that know not God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a Poſitive Unbelief; and this is, when men are ready to diſtruſt Gods Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and his Providence, and his Promiſes; or, when we do not ſo fiducially reſt upon them, as to obey the Goſpel. This is a Poſitive unbelief; this is the ſin which is ſo dangerous. Now you muſt know this Poſitive Unbelief is twofold:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, Temporary.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Total, or Final.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a Temporary unbelief; and this
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:45614:136"/>is that which may befall even Gods own Elect, they may be under unbelief for a while. True, it is poſſible for an Elect Child of God, to be under an act of unbelief, though he cannot be brought into a ſtate of unbelief; for you muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two: between a ſtate of unbelief, and an act of unbelief. A Child of God may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an act of unbelief: ſo you know was Godly <hi>Zachariah</hi> (<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s husband), he was under an act of unbelief: <hi>And behold, thou ſhalt be dumb, and not able to ſpeak until the day that theſe things ſhall be performed, becauſe thou believedſt not my words, which ſhall be fulfilled in their ſeaſon,</hi> Luke 1.20. And <hi>Thomas,</hi> one of the twelve Apoſtles, he was under an act of unbelief, when he ſaid, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the Nails, and put my finger into the print of the Nails, and thruſt my hand into his fide, I will not believe,</hi> Joh. 20.25. So were all the reſt of the Apoſtles under an act of unbelief for a while; therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour when he was riſen again, he upbraided them (the Text ſays) with their unbelief, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.14, <hi>After he appeared to the Eleven as they ſate at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardneſs of heart, becauſe they believed not them which had ſeen him after he was riſen.</hi> This is a Temporary Unbelief.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a Total or Final unbelief, and that is the ſin of thoſe that live in a ſtate of impenitency, and abide in that condition; thoſe that abide in their unbelief, until the wrath of God abides upon them. You ſee what this unbelief is: a diſtruſting of Gods Power, and Providences, and Promiſes; and that not for a time, which may be the condition of a Child of God; but when it
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:45614:137"/>is a Total and Final unbelief. That's the firſt thing for Explication.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By way of Explication; it may be demanded, Why is this ſuch a dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive ſin, that it does debar men of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan?</hi> I ſhall give you theſe three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe you muſt know it is a ſin that robs God of his Glory. Look, as by believing we do moſt of all honour God; for by this we ſet to our Seal that he is true, <hi>John</hi> 3.33, <hi>He that hath received his Teſtimony, hath ſet to his Seal that God is true.</hi> By believing, we give him the honour of his Truth, and Faithfulneſs, and Mercy, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Power. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> by believing, gave glory to God, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20, <hi>He ſtaggered not at the Promiſe of God through unbelief; but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God.</hi> So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by unbelief we diſhonour him in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: nay, in the higheſt degree that can be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe we make him a Liar, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10, <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witneſs in himſelf; he that believeth not God, hath made him a Liar, becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave him of his Son.</hi> Now what greater reproach or diſhonour can be caſt upon a man of worth, than to give him the lye? Unbelief therefore is a bold ſin; it ſteps into Gods Cabinet, as I may ſay, and it robs him of the choiceſt Jewel that he hath; namely, his Glory: which he hath ſaid, He will not give to another, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8, <hi>I am the Lord, that is my Name, and my Glory will I not give to another, neither my praiſe to the graven Images.</hi> The glory of God, it is nothing elſe but the reputation that God hath in the World. Take away Gods glory,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:45614:137"/>and the reputation that he hath among the Sons of men, then (with reverence be it ſpoken) he is little worth in the eyes of men. Now Unbelief is that that robs God of his Glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Unbelief is ſuch a dangerous deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive ſin, becauſe it is the firſt ſin that ever was in the World. As it is the mother of all other ſins, ſo it was the firſt ſin whereby the Devil got entrance into the heart of man. I know there is a diſpute amongſt Divines, What was the firſt ſin our firſt Parents were guilty of, whether Pride, or Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? without all doubt it was Unbelief; for God told our firſt Parents expreſly, Whenever they did eat of <hi>the Tree of life, they ſhould die the death:</hi> as ſure as they lived, they ſhould die; but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil he goes and tells them, <hi>You ſhall not die.</hi> Now mark: they believed the Devil, more than they believed God; Unbelief therefore was the firſt ſin that ever was committed in the World: and as it was the firſt ſin whereby the Devil got entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of man, ſo may it be ſaid to be the root and mother of all other ſins; therefore ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Take heed, Brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God,</hi> Heb. 3.12. Look as Faith may be ſaid to be the Mother of all other Graces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Faith lets in Jeſus Chriſt into the Soul, and ſo purifies the heart: <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9, <hi>And put no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between us and them, purifying their hearts by Faith:</hi> it applyes the purifying-blood of Jeſus Chriſt: So on the other ſide, Unbelief may be ſaid to be the mother of all other ſins, becauſe it keeps out Chriſt, and keeps out Grace, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes the heart, and defiles it, and makes it no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Den for Satan to lodg in. It is a good
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:45614:138"/>obſervation of an eminent Divine, whom for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſake I mention, namely, Doctor <hi>Sibs: Look as the firſt return of the Soul to God, is by Faith; ſo the firſt departing of the Soul from God, is by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief;</hi> for, from thence comes a departing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins; and ſo unbelief being encreaſed, the rent that is made between God and the Soul, the eſtrangement between God and the Soul, is ſtill made wider and wider; and ſo the Soul departs further and further, and is ſtill departing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from one ſin to another, till at laſt it comes to hear that fatal and final ſentence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25, <hi>Depart thou curſed wretch into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may Unbelief be ſaid to be the Mother of all other ſins. Unbelief and Apoſtacy are very near akin: Unbelief may in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to be all diſobedience. The ſame Greek word that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies unbelief, ſignifies alſo diſobedience, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.6, <hi>For theſe things ſake the wrath of God cometh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the children of unbelief,</hi> or <hi>children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And well may it be ſaid to be the Mother of diſobedience: for what ſin is there ſo groſs and grievous, that an unbeliever will not run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? If a man believe not the threatnings, he will practice no good: For example, if a man do but believe that terrble Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8, <hi>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Lyars, ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death.</hi> If a man did believe that Scripture, durſt he be a Coward to betray the Truths of God? God ſpeaks of the fearful ones in that ſenſe, to be cowardly Chriſtians: did
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:45614:138"/>he believe this? durſt he be ſuch an abominable wretch, to run into ſuch abominable blaſphemies (which are not to be named) which are belched out againſt God in theſe days? Durſt he be an Idolater, a Lyar, a Swearer? certainly he durſt not; but he does not believe the Threatnings of God. If a Tyrant ſhould threaten any of you with the Rack, or Strapado, which would break your bones: Oh, what terror and trembling would take hold of you! how would you fall down at his feet, and ſeek his face and favour! yet that Tyrant could take away nothing but a poor, miſerable, mortal life: But the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he threatens Sinners with the puniſhment of loſs: the loſs of his preſence, of his favour, of fellowſhip with him in Glory; nay, he threatens with the puniſhment of Senſe, thoſe unconceivable tortures and torments in Hell for ever, to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; and yet Sinners do not tremble at this great God, they do not fall down and ſeek his face and ſavour; What is the reaſon? becauſe they believe not. If ſo be a faithful man, that was never yet known to break his word, and a man of a great Eſtate, that was able to make good his promiſe; if he ſhould promiſe any of you an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of two or three hundred by the year, you would believe that man on his word, and you would ſeek to pleaſe him, you would prize his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but now the great God of Heaven and Earth, that was never yet known to break his Word: he tells you of an heavenly <hi>Inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, reſerved in Heaven;</hi> and yet do you not ſeek to pleaſe him, or prize his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or obey him? what's the reaſon? <hi>Becauſe you believe not his Word.</hi> So the truth is, unbelief
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:45614:139"/>is the Mother of all diſobedience. That's the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Unbelief is a ſin thus dangerous and deſtructive to the Soul, becauſe God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more Antidotes and Remedies againſt this ſin of unbelief, than againſt any other ſin, to cure this ſin of Unbelief.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God hath given us his Word, which is a moſt faithful Word: <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>but my words ſhall not paſs away,</hi> Matth. 24.35.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God hath given us his Promiſes. Now all his Promiſes are <hi>ſure and certain, Yea and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> God is faithful, and will make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20, <hi>For all the promiſes of God in him are Yea, and in him are Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, He hath given us his Covenant: and this Covenant is ſure and ſtedfaſt, and ordered in all things, an everlaſting Covenant, ſealed with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and cannot be altered, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5, <hi>Although my Houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ordered in all things, and ſure: for this is all my Salvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, He hath given us his Oath, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8, <hi>Yea, I ſware unto thee, and entred into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> Now an Oath you know is the ſtrongeſt bond of aſſurance between man and man. And the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Word of God, and of the Oath of God: that they are two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things, wherein it is impoſſible for God to lye, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18, <hi>Wherein God willing more
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:45614:139"/>abundantly to ſhew unto the Heirs of the Promiſe, the immutability of his Counſel, confirmed it by an Oath, that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi> As it is impoſſible for God to die, becauſe he is life it ſelf; ſo it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for God to lye, becauſe he is Truth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Becauſe he hath given us his Seal alſo: he hath given us his outward Seal, which is the Sacrament, both the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; he hath given us alſo his inward Seal, which is the Witneſs and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his own bleſſed Spirit, <hi>ſealing us up to the day of Redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, He hath given us Experiences; former Experiences, and latter Experiences: the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all the Saints that have gone before us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22.4, <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee; they truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thou didſt deliver them.</hi> So in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34.6, <hi>This poor man cryed</hi> (ſpeaking of himſelf) when he was in as low a condition as ever he was in: (ſcrabling on the ground, and feigning himſelf mad, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.13,) ſays he, <hi>This poor man cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his trouble;</hi> Therefore others will be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad, when they hear how graciouſly he hath dealt with them. So in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9.10, <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee; for thou Lord haſt not forſaken them that ſeek thee.</hi> Now God hath given us experiences, he hath given us all theſe Antidotes and Preſervatives againſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; hearken therefore, O Unbeliever! Well, If thou do not believe, thou muſt periſh everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:45614:140"/>God remains faithful, and cannot deny himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13, <hi>If we believe not, yet he abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf.</hi> But if thou do believe and periſh; if thou do believe, and yet art damned: then God hath broken his Word, and broken his Promiſe, and broken his Covenants, and broken his Oath, and broken the Seals of his Covenant; which is as impoſſible, as for God to ceaſe to be God. You ſee God hath provided ſo many Remedies and Antidotes againſt Unbelief, therefore unbelief is ſuch a dangerous and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive ſin. It is obſervable, when our Saviour came to his own Countrey, that was <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and preach'd to his own Country-men, and did Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles among them, <hi>they believed not;</hi> The Text ſays, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.6, <hi>He marvelled becauſe of their unbelief.</hi> You do not read he marvelled at other ſins: as Ignorance, Hypocriſie, Pride, Covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but our Saviour <hi>marvelled at their unbelief.</hi> Oh, when men ſhall ſin againſt the Word of God, and the Promiſe of God, and the Covenant of God, and the Oath of God, and the Seal of God: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth may ſtand amazed at their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible incredulity. Thus you ſee the Point o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of the Point.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of <hi>Examination:</hi> I beſeech you to bring your hearts to the Touch-ſtone, and ſee whether you be guilty of this ſin of unbelief, yea, or no. I know every one of you will be ready to plead, Not guilty; Oh, we do believe the Word of God, and pity we ſhould live, if we did not believe the Word: But let me tell you, This is an inward, ſecret, lurking ſin, therefore not eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. But that you may know whether you be
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:45614:140"/>guilty of this ſin or no, I will give you theſe four plain undeniable Scripture-Evidences; the Lord make you your own Judges in this particular.</p>
            <p>Firſt, When men do ſlight the invitations of Jeſus Chriſt, ſlight the proffers of his Grace, it is a token there is unbelief in the bottom: for where Faith is once wrought in the heart, there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and readily a cloſing between Chriſt and the Soul: there is a ready cloſure, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Load-ſtone and the Iron: When Jeſus Chriſt ſays to a poor ſinner, <hi>Come to me, though thou art weary and heavy laden;</hi> the Believing Soul cloſes preſently with Chriſt, and anſwers, <hi>Come thee, Lord; I, I will creep to thee upon my hands and feet:</hi> When Chriſt ſays to it again: <hi>Do this,</hi> or <hi>Do that;</hi> the Soul ſays again, <hi>O Lord, give me ſtrength to do what thou commandeſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what thou wilt.</hi> But now, when you find in you a backwardneſs to entertain Jeſus Chriſt in your hearts, this is a certain and undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your unbelief; and is not this your ſin? Alas, alas, let Jeſus Chriſt be tendred in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word from day to day; let him be proffered in the ſweeteſt anſt ſofteſt terms of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions and Exhortations; let Miniſters uſe their beſt Art and Arguments to woo, entreat, invite, and beſeech you to accept of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as he is tendred to you in the Goſpel; and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, we poor Miniſters can get no audience; I ſpeak of the moſt of you, not of all: ſcarce one of ten, ſcarce one of a hundred, will hearken to this Goſpel-invitation, to come unto Jeſus Chriſt, and to ſubmit to him, and to take him upon Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms. Our Saviour complains, in <hi>John</hi> 5.40, <hi>And ye will not come unto me, that ye may have life.</hi>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:45614:141"/>Though I would give you life, a life of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, a life of Grace, a life of Glory, <hi>Yet you will not come to me;</hi> that is, You will not believe in me: you will not embrace me; you will not ſubmit to me; you will not ſolace your Souls in me. Let the World call, and you run ſtraight: let the fleſh call, and you obey it ſtraight in the luſts of it; nay, let Satan call, and you readily hearken to him; but you will not hearken to me. Juſt ſo may the Miniſters of the Goſpel at this day complain, Lord, Thou ſendeſt us upon this Errand, to bring Sinners in to thee: thou ſendeſt us upon the ſame Meſſage <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent his Servant, to get a Wife for his Son <hi>Iſaac: Abraham</hi> gave his Servant Rings, and Jewels, and Bracelets, to beſtow upon her that would be Wife to <hi>Iſaac.</hi> So our Lord ſends us with Rings, and Jewels, and Bracelets: we have many Motives and Arguments to invite Sinners, and to perſwade and draw them: But Lord, we can do no good in our Miniſtry; we tell men of the unſearchable Riches of Jeſus Chriſt; and what an unvaluable portion they ſhall have in him, but they will not believe; <hi>Lord, Who hath believed our Report?</hi> Now, when there is a ſlighting of thoſe invitations and proffers of Goſpel-grace, it is a certain token of Unbelief. And that's the firſt Sign or Character of Unbelief.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When men undervalue Chriſts Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Portion; this is a token of unbelief. We tell men of the Beauty of Chriſts Perſon, that he is <hi>white and ruddy;</hi> white in his Innocency, and rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his Paſſion, the choiſeſt of <hi>ten thouſand,</hi> Cant. 5.10: and that there is nothing in him but bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſweetneſs, and beauty, and fulneſs, and all ſufficiency, yet men believe it not; <hi>They ſee
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:45614:141"/>no beauty in him, why they ſhould deſire him,</hi> Iſa. 53.3. Nay, <hi>What is thy beloved more than other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds?</hi> ſay they, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9. So when we tell men of the invaluable portion they ſhall have by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thoſe unſearchable Riches, the riches of his Merits, and the riches of his Spirit, and that rich and royal Redemption, and that they ſhall have whatever their hearts can deſire; we tell them of this, they ſhall have a portion of grace, Jeſus Chriſt will give them <hi>grace for grace;</hi> for every grace in himſelf, he will give them part of it: by his Wiſdom, they ſhall be made wiſe; by his Holineſs, they ſhall be made holy; he will give them a portion of Glory, a Crown of Eternal glory to them that love him: but becauſe they ſee not this Portion, this Crown of glory, they will not believe it, they will not believe further than they ſee, they are all for preſent pay: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas hath forſaken me, having embraced this preſent world:</hi> They will have good things for the preſent: as for future expectations, they regard them not. Where there is an undervaluing of Chriſts perſon, or portion, there is a great deal of unbelief.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When men are ſecure and fearleſs, it is a certain effect, and ſign, and ſymptom of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: for Faith breeds fear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7, <hi>By Faith Noah being wanned of God, of things not ſeen, as yet moved with fear, prepared an Ark, to the ſaving of his houſe: by the which he condemned the World, and became heir of the righteouſneſs which is by Faith.</hi> Faith makes men fear: But now when men do nto ſtand in awe of God, of the great God, that is within us, without us, above us, about us: when we do not walk as in his eye, nor walk as in his preſence; when men do not ſtand in awe of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:45614:142"/>the Word of God, and ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 119, 161, <hi>Princes have perſecuted me without a cauſe, but my heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I more ſtand in awe of thy Word, than of all the Princes of the World. When men are ſo over-awed by the Word of God, as that they dare not ſin againſt God; for the Word of God ſtands as a Schoolmaſter ſtands with a Rod in his hands over a Boy, ſo that he dare not act any untowardneſs. When men are not over-awed by the Word, but they ſin and ſpare not, they ſin and grieve not, this is a token of their unbelief: they do not believe God is Omniſcient, Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; they do not believe his Juſtice, they do not believe his Truth. Where men are thus fearleſs and ſecure, it is a plain token of their exceeding great unbelief.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A fourth Sign of unbelief, is this: when men profeſs one thing, and practice another thing: when their practice croſſes their Profeſſion, this is a certain token of reigning unbelief. Let me give you ſome inſtances: For example, You profeſs God to be your Soveraign Lord, and King, and Law-giver, and that you have but one Law-giver, which is God; and that he has power to ſave and to deſtroy, <hi>James</hi> 4.12, <hi>There is one Lawgiver, who hath power to ſave and to deſtroy.</hi> And you profeſs, <hi>That he can do whatſoever he pleaſeth in Heaven and in Earth, and among all the Inhabitants of the Earth: and that none can ſtay his hand, none can ſay unto him, what doſt thou?</hi> Dan. 4.35. You profeſs this God to be your Soveraign, yet for all this you make no bones of flighting his Authority: you dare flight the Authority of this Law-giver, and make no bones of breaking his
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:45614:142"/>Commandments. You can break the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment by Atheiſm, impenitency, hardneſs of heart, lukewarmneſs, unthankfulneſs: You can break the ſecond Commandment, by neglecting, or miſ-performing the duties of Gods Worſhip and Service: You can break the third Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by not honouring God, by not glorifying God; you do not ſanctifie and honour his Name, in his Word, in his Works, in his Providences, in his Ordinances, in his Mercies. You make no bones, I ſay, of breaking his Commands. Thus you profeſs one thing: you ſay, that the Lord is your Lord, your Law-giver; but you practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, when you ſlight his Authority, and break his Commands. See how angrily our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.46, <hi>And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I command you?</hi>— A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, You profeſs you believe the threatnings of God, ſuch dreadful threatnings as theſe: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt: this ſhall be the portion of their Cup,</hi> Pſalm 11.6. So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 68.21, <hi>God ſhall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch a one as goeth on ſtill in his treſpaſſes.</hi> You profeſs you believe theſe threatnings, but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your practice croſſes your Profeſſion: for, let a Miniſter come and thunder theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in your ears: yea, let a Miniſter come and ſpit fire and vengeance in the face of Sinners, yet notwithſtanding, they do no more tremble than the ſeat they ſit on. It were well if ſome Snners had but as much fear as the Devils have (<hi>James</hi> 2.19.) for they believe the threatnings of God, and fear them, and know they ſhall be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the uttermoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:45614:143"/>Thirdly, You profeſs that you believe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: I, that you do: I, but what Promiſes do you believe? You believe the Promiſe of Eternal life, becauſe you believe Jeſus Chriſt will be your Saviour: I, but do you believe the Promiſes (for example) for this life: Do you believe, if you ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs in the firſt place, all other things ſhall be caſt into the Bargain? <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. Again, Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Promiſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34.10, <hi>The young Lions do lack and ſuffer hunger: but they that ſeek the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Promiſes for this life? let that be judged by your Covetouſneſs, by your carking careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: that diſtracting, dividing care, that divides the mind from it ſelf. See what the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16, <hi>He that believeth, ſhall not make haſte:</hi> He therefore that does make haſte to be rich, does not believe; <hi>He that makes haſte to be rich, ſhall not be innocent,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 28.20. You therefore that make ſo much haſte to be rich: you that make ſo much buſling in the World: wherefore is this craving, carking, whining after the things of this life? It is a certain undeniable evidence of your diſtruſting Gods Providence and Promiſes: and let me tell you, You that will not believe him for the Body, you will never believe him for the Soul; You that will not believe him for your Eſtates and Children, you will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him for your Eternal Salvation; You that will not believe him for a Cruſt, you will never believe him for a Crown: And yet you ſay, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Promiſes, that you do.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You ſay, you believe in the mercy of God for pardon: I, but when once Satan comes
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:45614:143"/>to ſhake your confidence but a little, when you lie but under any temptation; when God ſeems to hide away his face from you, though never ſo little, in the day of your fears and ſtraits: then you are ready to queſtion, whether you are the Children of God, or no? whether there be any thing of God in you, or no? you are ready to ſay then as <hi>Sion</hi> did, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14, <hi>The Lord hath forſaken me, my Lord hath forgotten me;</hi> my way is hidden from the Lord, and my judgment from the Almighty. It may be you may come to that condition, to ſay with <hi>Cain, My puniſhment is greater than I can bear, my ſin is greater than can be forgiven,</hi> Gen. 4. God will never forgive ſuch great ſins as mine are. You ſay, that you believe in the mercy of God; but when it comes to the trial, it will be found no ſuch matter.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Again, You ſay you believe a day of Judgment, this is one thing you profeſs; I, but your practice is quite contrary: for, did you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it ſeriouſly, then you would <hi>paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. Did you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it ſeriouſly, then you would be affected with it, as that ancient Father was: <hi>Whether I eat, or drink, or whatever I do, methinks I hear the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſounding in mine ears, Ariſe ye dead, and come to judgment.</hi> If you did believe <hi>the terror of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.11, certainly then you would exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your ſelves to <hi>have Conſciences void of offence, both towards God and men,</hi> Acts 24.16.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, You ſay, you believe that there will be a Reſurrection of the Body: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding you carry your ſelves here upon the Earth, as if ſo be there was no account or reckoning to come. Some may be can live, (I am even aſhamed
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:45614:144"/>to ſpeak it), they can live as if they had no God to ſerve, and no Souls to ſave; as if there would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come a day wherein they muſt appear before their Judg. I remember the ſpeech of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> Acts 26.27, <hi>King Agrippa, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt thou the Prophets? I know</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that thou believeſt.</hi> But I may ſay to many an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, unregenerate, obſtinate, perverſe Sinner (Oh that there were none ſuch in this Congregation; I may ſay to many ſuch Sinners) Believeſt thou the Word of God? Believeſt thou the Threatnings of God? I know thou believeſt them not. If thou didſt believe the Commands of God, Oh then thou wouldeſt ſay with Saint <hi>Paul, What wouldeſt thou have me to do, Lord?</hi> Acts 9.6, <hi>Teach me the way of thy Statutes, O Lord, and I will walk in it, and I will keep it to the end,</hi> Pſalm 119.33. If thou didſt believe the Threatnings of God, then thou wouldſt be in the ſame condition that <hi>David</hi> was in, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.12, <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> If thou didſt believe thoſe dreadful Threatnings, thou wouldſt be in the ſame condition with the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk; My belly trembled, my lips quivered, rottenneſs entred into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelf,</hi> Hab. 3.16.— If ſo be thou didſt believe the Promiſes, Oh, thou wouldſt embrace them, thou wouldſt ſuck and be ſatisfied with thoſe <hi>Breaſts of Conſolation,</hi> Iſa. 66.11. It is ſaid of the Patriarchs, <hi>They ſaw the Promiſes after off, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them,</hi> Heb. 11.13. But now, when thou ſayeſt, thou believeſt the Commands of God, and yet never obeyeſt his Commands: thou ſayeſt, thou believeſt his Threatnings, and yet never trembleſt at any Threatning; thou ſayeſt, thou beliveſt the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:45614:144"/>Promiſes, and yet art no way thereby encouraged to a more active, and fruitful, and chearful walking with God: then thy Belief croſſes thy Profeſſion. And this is a certain and undeniable Evidence of Unbelief: the Lord awaken ſome of you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, and ſend you home to your own hearts, to ſee how deeply you ſtand guilty of this ſin my Text ſpeaks of: for if there be not reigning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief in many of you, for my part I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scripture.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe with a word of <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it ſo, <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief is one main cauſe why ſo many men deſpiſe and undervalue that Heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, and are debar'd from that Heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan?</hi> Then I have a twofold <hi>Exhortation</hi> to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to you: The
<list>
                  <item>Firſt is to thoſe that are Regenerate.</item>
                  <item>Secondly: To thoſe that are Unregenerate.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, To thoſe that are Regenerate: And my Counſel to you, is this, Oh do not mourn for the dregs of this ſin that yet remain in you: there are dregs of Unbelief, even in thoſe that are true Believers. That man or woman that is not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the dregs of this ſin in him, I ſay, then he is a ſtranger to his own heart. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Let your Converſation be without Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have; for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> There you have a Promiſe, <hi>He hath ſaid;</hi> Who is it that hath ſaid it? The Great God of Heaven and Earth, that can make it good; How hath he ſaid it? how? with the greateſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or aſſeveration that ever Promiſe was made; for he that hath skill in the Greek Tongue, ſhall find there five Negatives in that one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:45614:145"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I will not forſake thee;</hi> that is not enough: but ſays God, <hi>Be aſſured, I will not forſake thee: no, no, no, no, I will not forſake thee;</hi> ſo many No's, therefore be aſſured. As if the Lord ſhould ſay it as the greateſt Aſſeveration, and with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt earneſtneſs, that ever we read of any Promiſe made with. Yet, let me tell you (and it is what you will find by your own experience), Though in time of proſperity it is an eaſie matter to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume: yet in time of adverſity, it is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to believe this Promiſe; when we come into ſtraitneſs, to ſay, God will not leave me nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, he will not leave me in the Bryars: nay, though you and I have had experience of Gods faithfulneſs to this day, we had experience of his faithfulneſs when we were in our Mothers womb. As a learned man once ſaid, <hi>If a man ſhould live to the days of Methuſelah: if he ſhould live a thouſand years, he could never have that experience of Gods power, and tender mercy to him, as he had when God preſerved him in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, and took him out of his mothers belly.</hi> We have had experience of Gods preſerving us then: and we have lived upon him ever ſince, ſome twenty, ſome thirty, ſome forty, ſome fifty years; all this time God did never leave us, nor forſake us: yet if we be in ſtraits, we find it a very hard matter to believe that one Promiſe, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Oh therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail, and bemoan the dregs of Unbelief: cry out with that good man, <hi>Lord, I believe; I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, help my unbelief.</hi> That is the firſt <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I have an <hi>Exhortation</hi> to thoſe that are in a ſtate of unbelief, unregenerate, impenitent
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:45614:145"/>wretches that go on in ſin, and will not be reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſlight the invitations of Jeſus Chriſt, and the proffers of his Grace. My Counſel to you is this, and I have but two words of Counſel to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to you:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, Be ſenſible of this ſin.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Labour to get this ſin removed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Be ſenſible of this ſin; be ſenſible of the greatneſs of it, be ſenſible of the hainous nature of it: what? to turn the Truth of God into a Lye: what? to make the great God of Heaven and Earth a Lyar: what? to rob him of his Glory: what? to go into his Cabinet, and ſteal away his chiefeſt Jewel: Can there be a greater ſin?—Be ſenſible of the danger of this ſin, it brings imminent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable deſtruction along with it. Tremble at that Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 3.18, <hi>He that believeth not, is condemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d already, becauſe he hath not believed on the Name of the only begotten Son of God;</hi> he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: a ſentence of death is paſt upon thee, if thou be in a ſtate of Unbelief.</p>
            <p>Secondly, My other word of Counſel is this: Oh labour, labour to get this curſed ſin of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief deſtroyed in you: O let this ſin be deſtroyed, or elſe thou muſt be deſtroyed: But you will ſay, <hi>How ſhall we get this ſin of unbelief cured?</hi> I will tell you, Will you hearken to me in four or five Rules? and then I have done.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Take heed of Atheiſm; for I profeſs, we are fallen into days of Atheiſm, and all our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (if the Lord be not merciful to us) will end in Atheiſm; Infideliſm and Atheſm, there is but one ſtep between them: what is Atheiſm but when men will not believe there is a God? all Inſidelity ſprings from Aheiſm. But you will ſay, <hi>What, do you think
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:45614:146"/>we are Atheiſts? Do you think that we believe there is not a God?</hi> Let me tell you, There are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts in Opinion, as well as Atheiſts in Language: <hi>The Fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God;</hi> there are Atheiſts in practice, as well as Atheiſts in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; <hi>They profeſs they know God, but in works they deny him.</hi> Take heed therefore of this curſed ſin of Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Would you have Unbelief removed, then learn to know more of God: to know more of his Goodneſs, Wiſdom, Holineſs, Purity, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and other of his glorious Attributes: <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee.</hi> I am ſure, did you but know him, you would believe in him; you would obey him, you would fear before him. <hi>I know whom I have believed,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Reſolve to practice what you do know, if you would be Believers: you muſt know that there are many things a man may believe notionally, which he does not believe practically: I ſhall give you an inſtance. There is never a one of you that hears me this day, but believes you are mortal: you believe you ſhall die, you verily believe that, as you believe there is a Sun in the Firmament: yet notwithſtanding, though you do believe this; yet many of you can live as ſecurely, as merrily and madly, as if ſo be you ſhould never drop down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the duſt; here now indeed is a notional Faith; I, but there is not a practical Faith: it is one thing to believe a Truth notionally, and another thing to believe it practically.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Would you have Unbelief removed? then, Oh beg, and beg earneſtly, that <hi>God would take away your hearts of ſtone, and give you hearts
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:45614:146"/>of fleſh:</hi> let this be your Prayer every day. Do you not remember how I opened that Text to you, <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you: and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 36.26? What is a ſtony-heart, but a ſenſleſs heart, a heart ſenſleſs of ſin, and a heart fearleſs of wrath? Now, do but obſerve, that unbelief and hardneſs of heart, they ſtill go together. In <hi>Mark</hi> 16.14, <hi>Afterwards he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the eleven, as they ſate at meat, and upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with their unbelief and hardneſs of heart.</hi> Our Saviour upbraids them for their unbelief and hardneſs of heart; Why are you ſo backward to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? it is becauſe of the hardneſs of your hearts.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I beſeech you to meditate often of the danger of Unbelief; meditate often what will be the woful Effects and Iſſues of your Unbelief: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Threatnings, the Precepts, and the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Almighty. In <hi>John</hi> 8.24, <hi>I ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto you, that you ſhall die in your ſins: for if you believe not that I am he, you ſhall die in your ſins.</hi> What? die in ſin! Oh, what greater curſe can poſſibly be uttered! To die in ſin, to rot in ſin, to come out of your graves in ſin, to be preſented before your Judg in your ſins! <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>ult. He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life, and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> The wrath of God abideth on him: If it were only for a few days, it might be born; I, but it will be abiding, and abiding, and abiding to all Eternity: the wrath of God will abide upon that Soul that does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. In a word, and ſo I have done: As God ſpeaks to the Prophet in another caſe, <hi>They will
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:45614:147"/>not ſee, but they ſhall ſee:</hi> I apply it thus, You that will not believe, I promiſe you, you ſhall believe; you that will not believe ſavingly, you ſhall believe deſperately; you that will not believe that God is ſo juſt, ſo ſtrict; ſo ſevere; you ſhall believe when you feel the wrath of the Almighty ſeizing upon you, never to be removed; you that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve now to the ſaving of your Souls, you ſhall believe as the Devils, to believe and tremble: you then will believe the torments of Hell in that day, when you feel them in that place where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth: It is better to believe theſe things now, than believe them when you feel them. The Lord work theſe things upon our hearts, that this Soul-deſtroying ſin may not be our ruin.</p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, He ſhews what the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is in himſelf; in <hi>ver.</hi> 4, <hi>To whom coming as to a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtone, diſallowed indeed of men, but choſen of God, and precious.</hi> He is a living ſtone, a ſtone that hath life in himſelf, and a ſtone that gives life unto others: <hi>For he that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not life,</hi> 1 John 5.12. —And not only a <hi>living ſtone,</hi> but he is <hi>choſen of God,</hi> and very <hi>precious;</hi> the Pearl of the Goſpel, that precious only excellent one, in compariſon of whom all the Kingdoms of the World are but as a heap of dung:— But then, as the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends him for what he is in himſelf, ſo he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Jeſus Chriſt, by what he hath done for all thoſe that believe in him. In the 5th <hi>ver. Ye alſo as lively ſtones, are built up a ſpiritual Houſe, an holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This invaluable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit you ſhall have by him; you ſhall not only be juſtified by him, but you ſhall be ſanctified: you ſhall be made a holy Prieſthood, and all your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices ſhall be made acceptable through him. To confirm this weighty Truth, the Apoſtle produces a Teſtimony out of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Iſa.</hi> 28.16, <hi>Therefore ſaith the Lord God; Behold, I lay in Sion for a Foundation, a ſtone, a tryed ſtone, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious corner ſtone, a ſure foundation; he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, ſhall not make haſte.</hi> Having thus confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Doctrine, he makes Application of it in this Verſe: and this Application is by way of Comfort to Believers, and diſcomfort to thoſe that believe not.—Firſt, It is a Doctrine that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:45614:148"/>affords a great deal of comfort to Believers: <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to you that believe, Jeſus Chriſt is precious:</hi> But it adminiſters a great deal of diſcomfort to Unbelievers, <hi>To them that are diſobedient,</hi> to them that hearken not to the voice of Chriſt; for, ſays the Apoſtle, Though this Chriſt be deſpiſed by them, yet he ſhall be infinitely advanced: he is become the Head, the Corner-ſtone: and they, notwithſtanding their deſpiſing of him, ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly ruined; for he will be to them a <hi>ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-ſtone, and a rock of offence,</hi> even to them which ſtumble at the Word, being diſobedient. This is the Connexion, or Context of theſe words with the former. It is the firſt Branch of the Text here that I principally aim at, in theſe words, <hi>To you therefore that believe, he is precious.</hi> The words (therefore) hath reference unto the fore-going verſe: wherein the Apoſtle tells us, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ſuch a Foundation-ſtone, ſuch a Corner-ſtone, ſuch a rock of Salvation, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>believes in him, ſhall not be confounded,</hi> ſhall not be condemned; <hi>For there is no condemnation to them that have a part and intereſt in him,</hi> Rom. 8.1. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Certainly to you he muſt needs be very precious:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, You have an infinite, and an invaluable benefit by him, therefore you have great reaſon ſo highly to prize him; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you that do believe:</hi> that is, that can reſt and rely upon this Rock of Salvation, that can pawn your Souls upon him, that can cloſe with him, and cleave to him, and obey him as your Prince and your Saviour; <hi>

               <hi>Doct. 1.</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is infinitely precious in himſelf.</p>
            <p>He is called in the 4th verſe of this Chapter, <hi>A living-ſtone, choſen of God, and precious.</hi> And in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16, <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I lay in Sion for a foundation, a ſtone, a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtone, a precious Corner-ſtone, a ſure Foundation.</hi> For the better underſtanding of this Point, two things are to be opened:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, What it is to be Precious, or what may be included in this Phraſe, <hi>precious.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, How this may be applyed to Jeſus Chriſt; or wherein the preciouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt conſiſts.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, What is it to be precious? What is includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Phraſe, <hi>precious?</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies divers things: I will name you but theſe five or ſix; and every one of thoſe ſignifications, are rightly applicable to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the word <hi>precious,</hi> is taken for <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>glorious.</hi> Thus the Sun and the Moon are ſaid to walk in brightneſs, <hi>Job</hi> 31.26, <hi>If I beheld
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:45614:149"/>the Sun when it ſhined, or the Moon walking in brightneſs. Job</hi> there ſpeaking of the Moon, ſays, it <hi>walks in brightneſs.</hi> it walks as it were through the Heavens honourably, it walks in a great deal of brightneſs and glory. Thus the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in this ſenſe is precious, becauſe he is the glorious <hi>ſun of Righteouſneſs;</hi> as he is called, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you that fear my Name, ſhall the ſun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ariſe with healing under his wings.</hi> And he calls himſelf <hi>the bright Morning-Star,</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16, <hi>I am the bright Morning-Star.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p>Secondly, The word <hi>precious,</hi> is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for that that is ſcarce and rare to be had; for that which is not beſtowed upon all, but upon ſome few perſons. Thus the Word of God in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s time, was ſaid to be <hi>precious,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.1, <hi>And the Word of the Lord was precious in thoſe days:</hi> there was no open Viſion; it was communicated but to a few. And in this ſenſe alſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be ſaid to be <hi>precious,</hi> becauſe he is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated but to a very few; <hi>A little Flock,</hi> Luke 12.32, <hi>A little little Flock,</hi> as the word ſignifies, a very little Flock in compariſon of thoſe that have no intereſt in him, nor any benefit by him: <hi>For not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many Mighty, not many Noble are called,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26. There are but few, very few in compariſon of the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that have an intereſt in him: in that regard he is <hi>precious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Sometimes the word <hi>precious</hi> is taken for that which is dear and coſtly. So the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is very dear to his Father; the dearly beloved Son of his boſom, and his blood is very coſtly; it is called, <hi>precious blood.</hi> If the blood of all the Princes upon Earth had been ſpilt: nay,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:45614:150"/>if all the Angels in Heaven had loſt their lives, it had not been comparable to one drop of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which is called <hi>the blood of God,</hi> Acts 20.28, <hi>Take heed therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſelves, and to all the Flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The word <hi>precious,</hi> ſometimes is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for that which is pleaſant and delightful, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20, <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son? is he a pleaſant Child?</hi> There is the ſame word for <hi>precious,</hi> called <hi>pleaſant.</hi> In this regard the Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be called <hi>precious,</hi> becauſe he is ſo delightful to the Father, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: mine Elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, That may be ſaid to be <hi>precious,</hi> that is of very great and invaluable uſe, or that whereof we have an indiſpenſable neceſſity. Now in this ſenſe alſo Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>precious,</hi> he is of infinite uſe to a Believer; ſuch indiſpenſable need have we of him, that without him we muſt periſh ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly; <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his blood, you have no life in you,</hi> John 6.53.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That is ſaid to be <hi>precious,</hi> which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight, thou haſt been honourable, and I have loved thee; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will give men for thee, and people for thy life,</hi> Iſa. 43.4. And as I told you even now, the Original word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſiguifieth <hi>honour,</hi> as well as <hi>price.</hi> So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he is infinitely honourable, honourable in himſelf; all the Angels honour and admire him: and he is an Honour to his Church and Choſen, to all thoſe that have a part and intereſt in him; therefore he is ſaid to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:45614:150"/>be <hi>The glory of his people Iſrael,</hi> Luke 2.32, <hi>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> You ſee the firſt thing opened, What it is to be <hi>precious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the ſecond thing for Explication, is this: How this Title <hi>precious</hi> may be applyed to Jeſus Chriſt? or wherein does the preciouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt ſo much appear?—For anſwer to this, You muſt know, the preciouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, does appear in theſe ſix Particulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is exceeding, infinitely, unconceivably precious in his Perſon, God and Man united in one Perſon, Co-eſſential with the Father: that is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame Eſſence and Subſtance with him; in <hi>John</hi> 10.30, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> And he is Co-equal with the Father: <hi>He thought it no robery to be equal with God,</hi> Pbil. 2.6, <hi>Being the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Fathers Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> Heb. 1.3. Therefore he is infinitely precious in his Perſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As he is precious in his Perſon, ſo is he precious in his Titles: thoſe rich and glorious Titles that are attributed to him. For Example, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, <hi>This is the name wherewith the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is called, Wonderful Counſellonr;</hi> El, <hi>the Mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi> Pray mark with what a glorious Title he is called there, <hi>The Mighty God;</hi> How dare then any blaſphemous <hi>Arrian,</hi> or <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> deny the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, deny that he is God; when this is one of the Titles wherewith he is called, <hi>The Mighty God, The Everlaſting Father, The Prince of Peace?</hi> What glorious Titles are here? So you ſhall read he is called <hi>his Fathers delight,</hi> Iſa. 42.1, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:45614:151"/>mine Elect in whom my ſul delighteth.</hi>— And the Fathers boſom-friend, <hi>John</hi> 1.18, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, ſave the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> If the love of all the Parents in the World were concentred in one, it were but as a drop of that infinite Ocean of Love, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son: —Nay more, he is called the <hi>Fathers Fellow,</hi> Zech. 13.7, <hi>Awake O Sword, againſt my Shepherd, and againſt the man that is my Fellow, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he is called <hi>The Head of the Church,</hi> Eph. 5.23: and <hi>the Judg both of quick and dead,</hi> Acts 10.42. In a word, ſuch is the Dignity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: ſuch is the Excellency of his Merits: ſuch is the ſweetneſs of his Graces; ſuch is the fulneſs of his Perfection, that the Scripture does abundantly put thoſe terms of honour upon the Lord Chriſt; as ſometimes comparing him to a <hi>Corner-ſtone,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he does ſupport us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>A Vine,</hi> becauſe he does refreſh us, <hi>John</hi> 15.1. Sometimes unto a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> becauſe he does heal us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.12. Sometimes to a <hi>Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar,</hi> becauſe he does enlighten us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16. Sometimes to <hi>A Shepherd,</hi> becauſe he does lead us, <hi>John</hi> 10. Sometimes to <hi>Manna,</hi> or <hi>the Bread of life,</hi> becauſe he does feed us; What glorious Titles are theſe that are given to Chriſt? therefore he is precious in his Titles.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As he is precious in his Titles, ſo he is precious in his Offices; in his Kingly Office, in his Prieſtly Office, and in his Prophetical Office.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is precious in his Kingly Office, he calls himſelf <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> Rev: 19.16, <hi>The King of Kings:</hi> He is ſuch a
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:45614:151"/>King that conquers the enemies of our Salvation: as Sin, and Satan, and Death, and Hell, and the World; other Kings Rule over us, but this King can only Rule in us: <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>The Kingdom of God is within you,</hi> Lnke 17.21. This King can make Laws that can bind the Conſcience; he is ſuch a King as hath all Power in Heaven and Earth committed to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18.</p>
            <p>Again, He is ſuch a Prieſt as hath <hi>reconeiled us to God the Father, and ever lives to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us, who is touched with the feeling of our infirmities,</hi> Col. 1.21. Heb. 7.25. Heb. 4.15. And he is ſuch a Prophet, as can perfectly inſtruct his Church; others may preach to the ear, but he hath his Pulpit in Heaven only, that can preach to the heart; other Preachers can open the Scriptures, but it is Jeſus Chriſt only that can open our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, that we may underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.45, <hi>Then opened he their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, that they might underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> O what glorious Offices are theſe?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He is precious in his Ordinances: For Example, His Word is exceeding precious to all thoſe that have taſted the ſweetneſs of it; how precious was it to <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 119.72, <hi>The Law of thy Mouth is better unto me than thouſands of gold and ſilver.</hi> How precious are Sabbaths to thoſe that know how much of Heaven is wrapt up in the Sabbath! Certainly, theſe Sabbath-days are Market-days for our Souls, wherein we may make proviſion for Eternity; days wherein the Lord Jeſus Chriſt many times communicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and much of his ſweetneſs to thoſe that wait upon him in holy Duties. And how precious is
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:45614:152"/>the Ordinance of the Lords Supper! wherein the Lord Chriſt makes us <hi>a feaſt of fat things, a feaſt of Wines on the Lees, of fat things, full of Marrow, Wines on the Lees well refined,</hi> Iſa. 25. Wherein he gives his own fleſh to eat, his fleſh that was crucified to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice; and his own blood to drink, that blood which only can quench the fire of Hell, quench the fire of Gods anger, which otherwiſe would have been burning, and burning againſt us to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As he is precious in his Ordinances, ſo he is precious in his Prerogatives; for he, and he only is the Saviour of the World, and beſides him there was no other Saviour, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12, <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other, for there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name under Heaven given among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we muſt be ſaved:</hi> That is, there is nothing can be named, for it is but a Hebraiſm; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be named under Heaven whereby we can be ſaved, but only the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> he had no Coadjutor, or Helper in the work of our Redemption, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3, <hi>I have trodden the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs alone, and of the People there was none with me; for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood ſhall be ſprinkled upon my garments, and I will ſtain all my rayment.</hi> And as he is the only Saviour, ſo he is the only Mediator too; <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. So he is the only Head of his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, <hi>And hath put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church.</hi> He only hath the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Authority, as being Omnipotent, and Omnipreſent, one that is able to protect his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:45614:152"/>from all injuries, one that is able to prevent all the plots and projects that are hatcht and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented againſt them: he hath theſe Prerogatives that cannot be given to any Creature in Heaven or Earth, but only unto him; therefore he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his Prerogatives.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Lord Chriſt is precious alſo in the purchaſe of his blood: the purchaſe he made for us by his blood, is a very precious purchaſe; and the portion that he beſtows on his Elect, that he hath purchaſed for them, is a precious portion; ſo he is precious, not only in regard of his Perſon, but in regard of his Portion. For Example, the Redemption that he hath wrought for us by his blood, is a precious Redemption; a Redemption from Sin, and Satan, and Death, and Hell; <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Epheſ. 1.7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The donation or beſtowing of his Spirit; it is a very precious gift, that the Spirit of God ſhould in his Name, that is for his Merit, be beſtowed upon all thoſe that do believe: <hi>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you,</hi> John 14.26. O what a precious, invaluable gift is it, to have the Spirit of God given us, to quicken us, to draw us to Jeſus Chriſt, and to carry on the work of Grace in us!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Graces of the Spirit, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are purchaſed by him, are precious Graces: Faith is a precious Grace, as it is called, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, <hi>Simon Peter, a Servant, and an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, to them that have obtained like precious Faith
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:45614:153"/>with us, through the righteouſneſs of God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; that the tryal of your Faith being much more precious than of gold that periſheth.</hi> The tryal of Gold is the worſt thing that belongs to Gold: and the tryal of Faith is the worſt thing that belongs to Faith: yet ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The tryal of your Faith is much more precious than that of Gold,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.7. So Repentance, that is a precious Grace, becauſe it is <hi>Repentance unto life,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18, <hi>When they heard theſe things, they held their peace, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied God, ſaying, Then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted Repentance unto life.</hi> — And Hope, that is a ſtedfaſt Grace, it is the Anchor of the Soul. And Love, that is a lovely Grace; it brings the Soul into nearer Communion with God.— Then Wiſdom, that is a precious Grace, a ſhining Grace: <hi>A mans wiſdom maketh his face to ſhine,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.1. And <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking of Wiſdom, ſaith he, <hi>Job</hi> 28.12, 13, <hi>But where ſhall Wiſdom be ſound, and where is the place of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding? Man knoweth not the price there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither is it found in the Land of the Living; it is of more price than Rubies:</hi> it is of an invaluable price. And Humility, that is an honourable Grace. And Fear, that is a preſerving Grace. And Patience, that is a ſupporting Grace. And Perſeverance, that is a Crowning Grace. All theſe Graces are precious Graces, and they are all of them beſtowed upon us, meerly upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Chriſts merits.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Priviledges that we have by Jeſus Chriſt, they are precious Priviledges: U-union with him, and Communion in his Life and Death, and Reſurrection, and Comforts: acceſs
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:45614:153"/>to God the Father, and that with boldneſs.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Promiſes that are ſealed by his blood, they are precious Promiſes: promiſes for this life, and promiſes for the life to come; that Promiſe, <hi>That all ſhall work together fer good to them that love God;</hi> a big-bellied promiſe, as I may ſo ſay. <hi>All things work together for good:</hi> and our prayers and our perſons ſhall be accepted.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Inheritance that he hath purchaſed for us, is a precious Inheritance; <hi>An incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven.</hi> In brief, Such is the preciouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that compare him with the moſt precious things that can be named, and you ſhall ſee they are but vile and baſe in compariſon of him: For Example, 1. The Souls of men and women, they are ſaid to be precious; but Oh, how infinitely precious is Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe blood is a valuable and equivalent price for the Souls of all the men and women in the world.—2. Light is ſaid to be precious; Chriſt ſaid of himſelf, <hi>I am the light of the world,</hi> John 8.12. Light is precious to thoſe that are in a Dungeon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Now, ſays Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>I am the light of the world.</hi>—3. Truth is precious, ſo precious that we are to buy it at any rate, and ſell it at no rate; Jeſus Chriſt ſays of himſelf, <hi>I am the Truth,</hi> John 14.6.—4. Fountains and Springs of water are precious in hot and dry Countreys: Oh the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is the Well of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.3, <hi>Therefore with joy ſhall ye draw water out of the Wells of Salvation.</hi>—5. Bread is precious to thoſe that are ready to periſh: a man will venture the getting of bread with the hazard of his life, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.9, <hi>We get our bread
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:45614:154"/>with the peril of our lives.</hi> Now Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> John 6.48.—6. Balm and Balſom is precious. His blood is the only Balm that can cure wounded Souls: ſo precious is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth, are but a picture of that beauty and preciouſneſs that is in him; he is the Abſtract and Epitome of all perfections: how precious muſt he needs be, to whom all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth do contribute all their Excellencies, to make him excellent and glorious! Thus you ſee the Point opened. Now for the Uſes of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of <hi>Information.</hi> Is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſo infinitely precious? you may ſee then, why the Souls of men and women are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, becauſe they are purchaſed by a precious Saviour, purchaſed by his precious blood. Hearken O ſons of men! why are you tumbling up and down in dirt and clay? why do you not raiſe your hearts and thoughts higher and higher, ſeeing that you have ſuch precious Souls, that are capable of a precious Inheritance? why do you not look after a precious Covenant of Grace, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ealed to you, and precious Promiſes confirmed to you by the blood of Chriſt? why do you not look after that precious Pearl, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is worth more than ten thouſand worlds? Oh the baſeneſs of the heart of man, that ſhould prefer dirt, and droſs, and dung, before him who is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely precious; that they ſhould ſo undervalue their precious Souls, that coſt ſuch an invaluable rate for their Redemption.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By way of <hi>Information;</hi> ſee the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible greatneſs of the ſin of Unbelief, that makes the Sinner undervalue this precious Redeemer.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:45614:154"/>Says Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>You will not come to me, that you might have life,</hi> John 5.40. Oh bewail your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that keeps Chriſt and your Souls, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſt and your poor Souls at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By way of <hi>Information;</hi> take notice what a bleſſed condition they are in, that have gotten the Lord Jeſus Chriſt into their Souls! If the Lord beſtows this gift of all gifts, this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſt upon you, Oh it is more than if he had given thee the World: nay, then if he had given thee ten thouſand Worlds for thy portion; O re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in thy portion; for as ſoon as ever thou art a Believer, thy heart is made a Cabinet for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pearl, the Lord Chriſt; for, <hi>He dwells in our hearts by faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. Oh, manifeſt to the World the brightneſs of this Pearl; let ſome luſtre of Jeſus Chriſt ſhine in thy Converſation, ſhine through this Cabinet, as Light ſhines through a Lanthorn.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Uſe is by way of <hi>Exhortation:</hi> And here I muſt but name ſome few particulars, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Explication of the Doctrine I inſiſted on more largely; and there are ſeveral Duties I would briefly commend to you, and the Lord give you hearts, and me a heart, and every one a heart to cloſe with this precious Truth tendred to you, in reference to this precious Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If Jeſus Chriſt be ſo precious in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as being God and Man: then learn to honour him, admire and adore him; for, <hi>This is the will of God the Father, that all ſhould honour Jeſus Chriſt, even as they honour the Father.</hi> See it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prefly commanded, in <hi>John</hi> 5.23, <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father:
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:45614:155"/>He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath ſent him.</hi> Why ſhould they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Son, as they honour the Father? becauſe he is ſo precious in his perſon, being God and Man united together in one perſon: therefore ſee that you honour him; therefore kiſs the Son with a kiſs of Reverence, of Love, and of Obidience, leſt his anger be kindled againſt you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſo precious in his Titles, as being the Delight of the Father, the Fathers Fellow, the Judg of the World, the Judg of quick and dead; O then, never give reſt to your eyes, nor ſlumber to your eye-lids: never reſt ſatisfied with any condition, with any portion, with any parts, priviledges whatſoever here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, till you have got an intereſt in him that is every way ſo precious; get him and get all, want him and want all. A man that catches at the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, you know loſes the ſubſtance; but get the ſubſtance, and you get the ſhadow with it. So long as you look after other things beſides Chriſt, you loſe him; but if you get him, you get the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of all: you get life, and peace, and comfort, and all that your hearts can deſire; be content to loſe all to get him, who when you have got, you ſhall be ſure never to loſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is Jeſus Chriſt ſo precious in his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as King, Prieſt, and Prophet? then do you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be experimentally partakers of all thoſe Offices, that you alſo may be Kings: <hi>And hath made us to be Kings and Prieſts to God and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Rev. 1.6. Labour to be Kings, in Ruling over your own luſts, over your own diſtempers, and paſſions: as he ſaid excellently. <hi>Do but conquer thy ſelf, and the world is conquered to thy hand.</hi> A
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:45614:155"/>greater victory it is for a man to conquer himſelf, than to conquer a Kingdom. Labour in this ſenſe to be Kings, that your iniquities may not have dominion over you, but that you may at length get victory over your luſts, which fight againſt your Souls. Again, labour to be ſpiritual Prieſts, to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices to God, acceptable through Jeſus Chriſt; and do you labour to be Prophets: that is, endued with ſuch wiſdom, and ſpiritual knowledg, that you may be able to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, and inſtruct one another. This is that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, to the great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14, <hi>And I my ſelf alſo am perſwaded of you my Brethren, that ye alſo are full of goodneſs: filled with all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, able to admoniſh one another.</hi> Do you, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, labour to be like Jeſus Chriſt, in all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Is Jeſus Chriſt ſo precious in his Ordinances? O then, do you labour to taſte the ſweetneſs of every Ordinance; taſte the ſweetneſs of the Word of God, that you may ſay, <hi>How ſweet is thy Word to my taſte! yea, ſweeter than Honey to my mouth,</hi> Pſalm 119.103. Taſte the ſweetneſs of Jeſus Chriſt in the precious Ordinance of the Lords Supper: that you may ſay, <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte,</hi> Cant. 2.3. And in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. His mouth is moſt ſweet; His mouth is ſweetneſſes,</hi> as the Hebrew phraſe carries it; and <hi>he is altogether lovely:</hi> He is moſt ſweet fn his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; O ſay, one hours Communion with him, is better than all the pleaſures of the World: one taſte of that ſpiced Wine, and of the juice of the <hi>Pomgranate,</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.2, <hi>I would
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:45614:156"/>lead thee, and bring thee into my mothers houſe, who would inſtruct me: I would cauſe thee to drink of ſpiced Wine, of the juice of my Pomgranate.</hi> One draught of that generous Wine, that ſpiced Wine, how pleaſant and delightful would it be to my Soul! Is Jeſus Chriſt ſo ſweet in his Ordinances: Oh then labour to taſte the ſweetneſs of Jeſus Chriſt in his Ordinances.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Is Jeſus Chriſt ſo precious in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives: he is the only Saviour, the only Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator: then ſubject your ſelves to him, and to none but him; be ſubject to him as your only Prince and Saviour: and ſay, <hi>O Lord our God, other Lords beſides thee have had Dominion over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy Name,</hi> Iſa. 26.13.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſo exceeding precious in the purchaſe of his blood? then do you labour to have an intereſt in his purchaſe; what is it for you to hear of the purchaſe of Chriſts blood, if this purchaſe be not yours, if you have not a ſhare and part in it? What is Chriſt, if he be not my Chriſt? What is his purchaſe, if it be not my purchaſe? For Example, If he hath purchaſed an Eternal Redemption by his own blood: O do you labour every day to get an aſſurance that you are in the number of his Redeemed ones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how may we know that?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, If you be the Redeemed of Jeſus Chriſt, then you will walk in the way of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed of Chriſt: and that way is called <hi>Holy,</hi> Iſa. 35.8, <hi>And an high-way ſhall be there, and a way, and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſhall not paſs over it, but it ſhall be for thoſe; the wayfaring men, though fools, ſhall not err there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> Hath he purchaſed, not only Redemption, but
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:45614:156"/>the Donation of his Spirit? Oh, do you beg the Spirit of God: that, that Gift, that great Gift, may be beſtowed on you, according to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (a Text I opened to you in many Sermons) <hi>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes: and ye ſhall keep my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and do them;</hi> Ezek. 36.27, <hi>If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. And do you put the Lord in mind of all thoſe gracious Promiſes that he hath made: <hi>I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine off-ſpring,</hi> Iſa. 44.3.</p>
            <p>Again, Hath he purchaſed ſuch precious Graces to be beſtowed upon all his Children, upon all thoſe that have an intereſt in him? O then, do you labour to be truly gracious: not only to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace, but renewing grace; not only common grace, but ſanctifying grace, ſound faith, ſincere love, unfeigned obedience, that you may have the graces of Humility, meekneſs, patience, that you may have the Image of Jeſus Chriſt ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon your Souls, that you may receive of his <hi>fulneſs, grace for grace:</hi> that you may in every grace of Chriſt have a part, that by his Wiſdom you may be made wiſe; by his Holineſs, we may be made holy.</p>
            <p>Again, Hath he purchaſed likewiſe ſuch preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Priviledges for his Children? O then, do you labour to be made partakers of thoſe precious Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, to be united to Chriſt, and to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, in his life: and becauſe he lives, you may live alſo; I mean, the life of Grace, and life more abundantly: and communion in his Death, becauſe he died for ſin, you may die to ſin;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:45614:157"/>and communion in his Reſurrection, becauſe he roſe from the Grave, you may riſe to holineſs and newneſs of life: And the like.</p>
            <p>Again, Hath he purchaſed ſuch precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and all thoſe Promiſes are ſealed in his blood, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20, <hi>For all the promiſes of God are in him, Yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</hi> O then, do you labour to be made partakers of thoſe Promiſes, that you may know that you are Heirs of thoſe Promiſes, that you may look upon them as Legacies, bequeathed to you by your dear Lord and Maſter; by your Husband Jeſus Chriſt, who left theſe Legacies to you.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Hath he purchaſed a precious Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>that is incorruptible and undefiled?</hi> then I beſeech you in the fear of Almighty God, that you take heed that it fares not with you, as it did with that unbelieving Prince, that ſaw the plenty in <hi>Samaria,</hi> but did not taſte of it, but died for all that; ſo you to hear of a glorious Inheritance, but to come ſhort of it, and ſo be undone to all Eternity, according to my Afternoon Text: <hi>Let us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into his Reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it,</hi> Heb. 4.1. Oh, hath he purchaſed this Inheritance? and do not you long to be with him, where you ſhall ſin no more, nor ſorrow no more? Thus you ſee what uſe may be made of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt in all theſe reſpects: as he is precious in his Perſon, in his Titles, in his Offices, in his Kingly, Prieſtly, and Prophetical Offices, in his Ordinances, in his Prerogatives, in the purchaſes of his Blood: thoſe precious Priviledges and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance he hath purchaſed for us. The Lord help us ſeriouſly to think on theſe things, and to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:45614:157"/>meditate upon them, and to lay them up in our hearts, as Cordials againſt a day wherein we may ſtand in need of them. And ſo I have done with the firſt Point of Doctrine, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is infinitely precious in himſelf.</hi> The other Doctrine is, <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is exceeding precious to all Believers, and is highly prized by them.</hi>

            <p>I Made entrance into this Text the laſt time that we had this ſolemn occaſion of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to God, in the uſe of this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ordinance of the Lords Supper; I ſhewed you the Coherence, Senſe, and ſcope of the words: and there were two Points of Doctrine that I drew from them. The firſt was this:
<q>That Jeſus Chriſt is infinitely precious in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I now come to the ſecond Doctrine drawn from theſe words: and that is this,
<q>As Jeſus Chriſt is precious in himſelf; ſo is he exceeding precious to all Believers, and highly prized by them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:45614:158"/>For the proof, or ſetling of this Point, before I come to open it to you, I ſhall give you but two Teſtimonies for the Confirmation of it: the one out of the Old Teſtament, the other out of the New; that out of the Old Teſtament, is in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9, 10: where you ſhall read, the ſtrangers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of the Spouſe, that is the Church of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>What is thy Beloved more than another Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, O thou faireſt among women? What is thy Beloved more than another Beloved, that thou doſt ſo charge us?</hi> The Church makes this anſwer, <hi>My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>My Beloved is white and ruddy;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt he is white in reſpect of his Divine Nature; <hi>Being the brightneſs of his Fathers Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> Heb. 1.3. And yet he is red in his Humane Nature, being of the ſame ſubſtance with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that was made of red Earth; He was <hi>white</hi> in his Holineſs, but yet he is <hi>red</hi> alſo in that bloody paſſion, which he was contented to undertake for our ſakes: he was <hi>white</hi> in his unſpotted Innocency, but yet he is <hi>red</hi> withal by the imputation of our ſins, which are ſaid to be <hi>Crimſon</hi> and <hi>Scarlet ſins,</hi> Iſa. 1.18, <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord; though your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool.</hi> Thus Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>white and rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi> I, but ſays the Church withal, <hi>He is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt among ten thouſand:</hi> or he is the Standard-bearer among ten thouſand, as the Hebrew word may be interpreted, <hi>the Standard-bearer;</hi> he is higher than the Kings of the Earth, therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Standard-bearer,</hi> Pſalm 89.27. <hi>Alſo, I will make my firſt-born higher than the Kings of the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:45614:158"/>Earth.</hi> He guides and leads his people, as being the Captain of their Salvation; he leads them as a Standard-bearer leads an Army by his Colours. Oh what a high price and value did the Church ſet upon Jeſus Chriſt here; <hi>He is white and ruddy, the choiceſt among ten thouſand:</hi> Chriſt was very precious you ſee in her eyes. The other teſtimony which I ſhall give you, is in the New Teſtament, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, <hi>Yea doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledg of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus my Lord; for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt.</hi> I count all things but loſs; whatever I eſteemed gain before, all my outward Priviledges that I ſtood upon before, I count them but as loſs: but that is not all, <hi>I count all things,</hi> ſays he, <hi>dung, droſs and dung:</hi> or as the Greek phraſe there ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignifies, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſuch things as we caſt out to Dogs: I account them but as ſcrapings, as skins, as parings, as nothing worth, in compariſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If there had been preſented to <hi>Paul</hi> a whole Mountain of Gold and Silver, and precious Pearls, in compariſon of Jeſus Chriſt, it would have been but as a heap of dung to him: <hi>I count all things</hi> (ſays he) <hi>but loſs and dung, in compariſon of Chriſt.</hi> Conſider but what things they were that he did undervalue, in compariſon of Chriſt, and conſider who did undervalue them. Conſider what it was that <hi>Paul</hi> did undervalue, all the Priviledges that he had: for example, He tells you in the 5th and 6th verſes, <hi>Circumciſed the eighth day</hi> (ſo outwardly in covenant with God, bearing the Covenant of God in his fleſh: this was nothing in his eſteem) <hi>of the ſtook of Iſrael, of the Tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:45614:159"/>Of the Stock of <hi>Abraham;</hi> this was his Birth-priviledg, but this was nothing: He was a man of Parts and Learning, brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel;</hi> but all his natural parts, abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and endowments, all theſe he eſteemed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: yea, he was a man of a civil and unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able converſation; <hi>touching the righteouſneſs which is in the Law, blameleſs.</hi> As to his outward man, he was blameleſs, none could ſay that black was his eye: yet all theſe Priviledges he eſteemed loſs and dung, in compariſon of Jeſus Chriſt.— And then conſider, who it was that did undervalue them; it was <hi>Paul,</hi> a Scholar, a man of Parts, a man of no mean City, but of the City of <hi>Tarſus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> Acts 21.39. It was <hi>Paul,</hi> that was not a Novice in Religion, that knew not what he ſaid; but <hi>Paul</hi> the Aged, that was well experienced in ſuch things, that knew very well what he ſaid; it is he that paſſes this account of all things, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Jeſus Chriſt; I, ſays he, eſteem all theſe Priviledges: and if I had a thouſand times as many more, I would eſteem them but loſs, and droſs, and dung, as nothing in compariſon of Chriſt. Oh, how invaluable was Jeſus Chriſt to holy <hi>Paul,</hi> that was a Believer!—</p>
            <p>But for the better underſtanding of this Point, that we may ſee how excellent and precious Chriſt is to a Believer, how highly he is prized by him:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, It may be demanded, Who are thoſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to whom Chriſt is precious?</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Why is Chriſt ſo precious to them?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Who are thoſe Believers to whom Chriſt is precious?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Not they that have only an Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:45614:159"/>Faith of Chriſt, to know that there was ſuch a Saviour that came into the World, and that he was God and Man; <hi>and that he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt thoſe that come to him.</hi> Nor they that have only a temporary Faith: ſuch a Faith as they had, which you read of in the Parable of the Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13, <hi>They that received the ſeed into ſtony places, the ſame are they which hear the Word, and anon with joy receive it; but they have no root; and for a while believe, but in time of temptation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, they fall away,</hi> Luke 8.13. Not they, I ſay, that thus have only an hiſtorical Faith, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a temporary Faith; but they are ſaid to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that are contented to take Jeſus Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own terms: to receive him as their King, and Prieſt, and Prophet: they that can be content to cloſe with him, and to cleave to him, as to the work of their Salvation, and that can ſay with <hi>Job, Though thou kill me, I will put my truſt in thee,</hi> Job 13.15. In a word, They are ſaid to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that can reſt and rely upon Jeſus Chriſt; that can caſt their Souls into his Arms, to ſink or ſwim with him, to live or die with him, to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or damned with him: it is the true Believer the Text here ſpeaks of: when the Apoſtle ſays here, <hi>To you that believe he is precious;</hi> you muſt not underſtand it of a formal believer, neither muſt you underſtand it of a hypocritical believer: you muſt not underſtand it of thoſe that have a falſe Faith, but of thoſe that have a true Faith. I told you not long ago, which ſome of you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, out of that Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22, <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of Faith;</hi> That there was a falſe and counterfeit Faith, as well as a true Faith; for example, I told you, —</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:45614:160"/>Firſt, That that is an eaſie Faith that is eaſily let into the Soul, without any work of conviction, contrition, and humiliation. That Faith that hath no tears, nor prayers, nor earneſt endeavours paid for the purchaſe of it, is cheap ware: and not worth a farthing. —</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Faith that is an idle, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual Faith, that is never working upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of God, to obey them: nor on the Promiſes of God, to embrace them: nor on the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God, to tremble at them.—</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That Faith that is an unthriving Faith, that never grows under the means of Grace. True Faith is a growing Faith, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3, ſays the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>We are bound to thank God always for you, Brethren, as it is meet: becauſe that your Faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all towards each other aboundeth.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That Faith that is a looſe and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith, that Faith that hath room for Chriſt, and room for any reigning luſt alſo: room for Chriſt, and room for the World, and the things of it: when a man can pretend love to Jeſus Chriſt, and yet live in a known ſin: whereas the true Faith purifies the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9, <hi>And put no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</hi> To them that have ſuch a Faith, this falſe counterfeit Faith, this eaſie, idle, unthriving, looſe and licentious Faith, to them Chriſt is not at all precious, they ſee no beauty at all in him. But they that have this true Faith, that is uſhered in by conviction and humiliation, that is a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, an operative and working Faith; this holy Faith, as it is called in the 26 verſe of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of Saint <hi>Jude; But ye, Beloved, building up
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:45614:160"/>your ſelves in your moſt holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> To them that have this true Faith, to them Jeſus Chriſt is precious, and they are the Believers the Text here ſpeaks of. So much of the firſt, who are thoſe Believers to whom Jeſus Chriſt is precious?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Why is Jeſus Chriſt ſo precious to ſuch Believers? You ſee who they are: but why is he ſo precious to them, ſo highly prized by them? Divers reaſons might be rendered: I ſhall give you theſe five or or ſix.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt is ſo highly prized by Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, becauſe they ſee the indiſpenſable need that they have of him: that without him they are loſt, dead, damned, and undone for ever; therefore they prize him, becauſe they know they cannot live without him; They know that a condemned Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner hath not more need of a pardon: a poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar that is ready to ſtarve in the ſtreets hath not more need of food: nor a naked man more need of cloaths: nor a ſick man, more need of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, than they have of Jeſus Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they prize him. They know they are fooliſh, yea, folly it ſelf, therefore they have need of him to be their wiſdom to guide them: they know they are guilty Sinners, therefore they know they have need of his Righteouſneſs to clear them; they know they are poluted and defiled Sinners, therefore they have need of his blood to purifie them; they know they are expoſed to the wrath of a Sin-revenging God, and the curſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Law, and the condemnation of the ſecond Death, therefore they have need of him to be their Redemption; They know that they are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely indebted, that they owe to God a debt of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:45614:161"/>ten thouſand Talents, which they are never able to diſcharge, and therefore they have need of Chriſt to be their Surety; they know they are weak, and able to do nothing without him; (<hi>without me,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>ye can do nothing),</hi> and they know Chriſt is their ſtrength, as well as Redeemer, and that through Chriſt they can do all things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth me.</hi> In a word, They know that Jeſus Chriſt is their Rock, their Refuge, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, their Peace, their Portion, their All, and therefore they ſee the infinite need they have of him, and that without him they are nothing: they can do nothing, they are worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, therefore they prize him. Here is one Reaſon why Jeſus Chriſt is ſo precious to true Believers, becauſe they ſee the infinite need they have of him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt is thus precious to true Believers, becauſe they ſee an invaluable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable beauty in him. It is true indeed, to Unbelievers, Jeſus Chriſt hath no beauty in him that they ſhould deſire him; as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2, <hi>For be ſhall grow up before him as a tender Plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comelineſs, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty, that we ſhould deſire him.</hi> A carnal earthly minded man, he ſays concerning Chriſt, as they did in the place before named, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9, <hi>What is thy Beloved more than another Beloved?</hi> What is there of ſo much beauty in Chriſt, that we ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eye him, obſerve him, prize him, or ſeek him, or look after him? <hi>Acts</hi> 4.11, <hi>This is the Stone which was ſet at nought by you builders.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is as a thing of nothing in an Unbelievers
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:45614:161"/>eye: ſuch a one makes no more reckoning of him (with reverence be it ſpoken) than the dirt under foot: Whereas Faith, you muſt know, hath an Eagles eye, it can ſee things afar off, it ſees a great deal of beauty in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; though in reſpect of any of theſe outward accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is no beauty at all in him; yet diſcerning things with a Spiritual eye, a Believer ſees Chriſt afar off, as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> John 8.56, <hi>Your Father Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> There was an eye of Faith in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham; He ſaw my day, and rejoyced.</hi> Hence it is, that believing in Chriſt is ſometimes expreſſed by this Phraſe of ſeeing Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.14, <hi>Ananias</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaid, <hi>The God of our Fathers hath choſen thee, that thou ſhouldſt know his will, and ſee that juſt one, and ſhouldſt hear the voice of his mouth.</hi> See him, that is, that thou ſhouldſt believe in him. Faith therefore ſees Chriſt; ſees him afar off, ſees him, though cloathed with our fleſh, with our infirmities. Faith looks upon Jeſus Chriſt, and does ſee him evidently crucified, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1, <hi>O fooliſh Galatians, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth crucified among you?</hi> Nay, Faith ſees a great deal of beauty in his ſufferings, how much more in his glory! for Example, <hi>Moſes eſteemed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures in Egypt,</hi> Heb. 11.26. Why? <hi>for he had reſpect unto the recompence of reward;</hi> he had the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted eye of Faith. You read in <hi>Mark</hi> 2, when the Wiſe men came from the Eaſt to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to enquire after him that was born King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that is, after Jeſus Chriſt; when they came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:45614:162"/>of him, they firſt came to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and they ſaw <hi>Herod</hi> (it may be) arrayed in all his glorious Robes: but we do not read, that they fell down and worſhipped <hi>Herod;</hi> then they came to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where they ſaw the Babe Jeſus wrapt in Swadling-cloaths, in a poor Garb (it may be little better than rags) yet they fall down and worſhip him. Now, what is the reaſon that they did not worſhip a magnificent glorious <hi>Herod,</hi> in all his Robes, but they worſhip a poor contemptible Babe in Swadling-cloaths? ſurely this was, becauſe they had a ſpiritual eye of Faith, they looked on Chriſt with an eye of Faith, therefore in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy they ſaw greatneſs; in his meanneſs they ſaw Majeſty; and more Glory in Chriſt in his Rags, than in <hi>Herod</hi> in his Robes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is thus precious to true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, becauſe they do not only ſee the need they have of him, and a great deal of beauty in him: but they do receive very rich and invaluable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by him for the preſent.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They receive many temporal mercies by him: all their temporal comforts come ſtreaming to them in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt is the Heir of all things, and all things are Believers by Chriſt; <hi>All things are yours,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>ſo far as you are Christs,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As they receive temporal mercies, ſo they receive many ſpiritual Priviledges, Graces, and comforts by him: They receive ſpiritual Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as Juſtification, Sanctification, and Adoption.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Juſtification. Oh what a Priviledg is this, that through Jeſus Chriſt God ſhould look upon Believers, not as Sinners, but as Saints! for God to ſay of them, <hi>Thou art all fair my Beloved, there
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:45614:162"/>is no ſpot in thee;</hi> in reſpect of Juſtification <hi>there is no ſpot in thee,</hi> though their Sanctification be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.7. Believers have the blood of Jeſus Chriſt to take away all their guilt: not only the guilt contracted in their unregenerate eſtate, but the guilt contracted in the eſtate of grace. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, ſays a Believer, when I have done a Duty, uſed a comfort, filled my Relations in the beſt manner I can, what would become of me if I had not a Saviour, a Mediator, to take away the iniquity of my holy Offerings? But now, this is a priviledg better worth than the Gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> nay better worth than the whole World; namely, by Jeſus Chriſt, and believing in him, <hi>We are juſtified from all things from which we could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes,</hi> Act. 13.39.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And as they receive the priviledg of Juſtification, ſo Believers receive the priviledg of Sanctification by him; for Chriſt is not only made to us Wiſdom by his Word, and Righteouſneſs by his Merit, but Sanctification alſo by his Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Chriſt is made not only a pattern of holineſs to us, but the principle of holineſs; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ſtrong in his Strength, and wiſe by his Wiſdom, and holy by his Holineſs, and meek by his Meekneſs; they have the Image of Jeſus Chriſt ſtampt upon their Souls: they know him in ſome meaſure, in the power of his death, killing and crucifying the <hi>old man,</hi> together with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and luſts thereof: they know him in the power of his Reſurrection, raiſing them up to a holy and Heavenly Converſation. Thus I ſay, they receive the priviledg of Sanctification by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:45614:163"/>Thirdly, And then they receive the Priviledg of Adoption too; as he is the Natural Son of God, Believers being united to him, they are partakers of his Son-ſhip, they are made the Sons and Daughters of God by Adoption: <hi>And I will be a Father to you, and you ſhall be my Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſaith the Lord Almighty,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, And ſo Believers receive ſpiritual grace from him. Look as the Oyl that was poured upon <hi>Aarons</hi> head, run down to the skirts of his cloathing; ſo from that fulneſs of Grace which is in Jeſus Chriſt, Believers receive, <hi>and grace for grace:</hi> a continual ſupply of grace from him, he is the Author of all their graces, he is the Author of their Faith; he is called <hi>The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finiſher of their Faith,</hi> Heb. 12.2. He is the Author of their Love; Chriſt firſt warms their hearts with a ſenſe of his Love, before they can love him; <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> 1 John 4.19. He is the Author of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: <hi>God hath exalted him to be a Prince, and a Saviour, to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins to his people,</hi> Acts 5.31.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And then they receive ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts by him too; <hi>My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave with you: not as the world giveth, give I unto yon; let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid,</hi> John 14.27. He gives Believers that peace that the World can neither give, nor take away from them; that peace and comfort, that can hold up their heads in all outward ſtorms: <hi>In the world</hi> (ſays he) <hi>you ſhall have tribulation, but in me you ſhall have peace,</hi> John 16. <hi>ult.</hi> At the ſame time, when they have tribulation in the world, they may have peace in Chriſt; at the ſame time
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:45614:163"/>when there is ratling upon the Tiles, there may be Muſick in the Chamber; outward tribulations, and inward conſolations, they may ſtand together at the very ſame time: <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy Comforts delight my Soul,</hi> Pſalm 94.19. So, though there may be multitude of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles within, yet there may be comforts to refreſh the Soul. This is the third Reaſon, why Jeſus Chriſt is ſo precious to Believers, Becauſe they have much in hand from Chriſt: they have Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Mercies, and Spiritual Mercies, Spiritual Priviledges, Juſtification, Sanctification, and Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and Spiritual Graces, and Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Jeſus Chriſt is very precious to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, becauſe they expect much from him. As they have much in hand by him, ſo they have more in hope from him; they have much for the preſent, but more for the future; for, what do they expect from him but an Inheritance incorrupted, undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, reſerved in Heaven for them: an everlaſting Kingdom, a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Communion with himſelf, boſom-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with himſelf in Glory; to have their Souls bathed in thoſe Rivers of pleaſure that are at his right hand for evermore: yea, the following the Lamb. whereſoever he goes, to be triumphing in his Praiſes, to be ſounding forth thoſe Hallelujahs to him that ſits upon the Throne for ever, to live and lie in his continual embraces: <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive, what God hath laid up for them that love him.</hi> Now, becauſe with the eye of Faith they look upon theſe things, and they fully expect to enjoy them: therefore hence it is they do ſo highly prize Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:45614:164"/>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Jeſus Chriſt is very precious to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: they do moſt highly prize him, Becauſe Faith you muſt know, is a uniting grace, an eſpouſing grace; it is the Wedding-Ring. as I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times told you, that makes up the Match between Jeſus Chriſt and the poor Soul: as ſoon as ever a man comes to be a Believer, to take Jeſus Chriſt to be his Head, his Husband, his Portion, then is the Match made up between them: <hi>Chriſt dwells in our hearts by Faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. Now then, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers being thus eſpouſed to him, thus united to him, they cannot but dearly love him. As a Wife that hath pitcht her affections upon a Husband, and forſaken all others: and hath vowed to cleave to him, and him only, while they both ſhall live, therefore ſhe does prize him above all the men in the World: ſo when the Soul is once united to Chriſt, marryed to him <hi>(Thy Maker is thy Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band);</hi> when the Soul is eſpouſed to Chriſt, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but dearly love him, and forſake all others in compariſon of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Jeſus Chriſt is very precious to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, Becauſe true Faith ever works by Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6, <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, but Faith which worketh by Love.</hi> True Faith will make a man dearly love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; now, if we love him, we cannot but prize him whom we love ſo dearly.</p>
            <p>The Uſe I ſhall make of this Point briefly:</p>
            <p>Firſt, For <hi>Examination.</hi> And, O that you and I could engage our own hearts a while, and call our ſelves to account in ſad and ſerious thoughts, whether Jeſus Chriſt be precious to us, yea or no; Is he highly prized by you, even by you that hear
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:45614:164"/>me this day? Can you ſay with the Church, <hi>My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand?</hi> And with St. <hi>Paul, I eſteem all things but droſs and dung, in compariſon of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> the whole World, the glory, the beauty, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and pleaſures of it, but as a heap of dung, in compariſon of him? this pitch and frame you muſt come unto, or elſe you can never have any aſſurance that Chriſt is yours, and that you are his; for, as our Saviour ſaith in the like caſe, <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. So here, if any thing be more prized than Jeſus Chriſt, you can have no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that Chriſt is your portion; if any thing be preferred before him, or prized more highly than he: is there not great need then, that you ſhould enquire whether Jeſus-Chriſt be precious to you, yea or no? That I may preſs you to this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, conſider but this one Motive: this is one of the ſureſt Characters to diſtingniſh between a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere-hearted Chriſtian, and an Hypocrite: For, he that is ſincere, and upright-hearted, does lay Jeſus Chriſt the neareſt to his heart, and ſays, <hi>None but Chriſt, nothing but Chriſt;</hi> whereas ever obſerve it, and you ſhall ſee a Hypocrite hath always ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that lies nearer to his heart than Jeſus Chriſt does; however he may ſhew much love to Chriſt with his mouth, yet his heart goes after his covetouſneſs, or after ſome baſe luſt or other; as God told the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31, <hi>And they come unto thee as my People, and they ſit before thee as my People, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs.</hi> So that Jeſus Chriſt hath not the heart of a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite;
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:45614:165"/>he may have the mouth of a Hypocrite, a ſhew of love, but there is ſomething ſtill that doth lie nearer his heart than Chriſt does. Look into the parable of the Sower; and you will find that Seed that was ſown in the ſtony-ground, it ſprung up and made a fair ſhew for a while, but there was ſomething that lay between the ſeed and the Soil; ſo there is ſomething that lies between Jeſus Chriſt and the Soul of a Hypocrite. You know the ſtory of the young man in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.22. When Jeſus Chriſt made him a fair proffer, <hi>Go and ſell that thou haſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and give it to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven, and come and follow me.</hi> He made a fair ſhew, but the world lay nearer his heart than Jeſus Chriſt did; therefore, when he bid them <hi>ſell all, and give to the poor: he went away very ſorrowful.</hi> And you know the ſtory of <hi>Orpah</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> Ruth 1. <hi>Orpah, ſhe gave her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law a kiſs, and bid her Farewel, but Ruth clave to her Mother Naomi.</hi> So it is here, It may be an Hypocrite can complement with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, can give him ſome outward Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial obſervance; but, when it comes to this, that he muſt part with any thing for Chriſt; when Chriſt tells him, If thou wilt be mine, thou muſt take me on my own terms: thou muſt look to bear my Croſs, as well as to wear my Crown; thou muſt look for Hatred, Perſecution, a Croſs, a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for my ſake, then he begins to ſhrink and draw back; I love Jeſus Chriſt well, ſays he, but I love pleaſures better, the World better, Liberty better, ſtill there is ſomething that a Hypocrite prizes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But then you will ſay, <hi>How may I do to know that Jeſus Chriſt is precious to me indeed?</hi> I will tell you briefly:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:45614:165"/>Firſt, See whether your deſires be ſtrongly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; whether they be vehement, conſtant, and induſtrious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, or no; for, if your deſires after Jeſus Chriſt be right, they will be very vehement deſires, like hunger and thirſt, that are commanding: The appetite hunger it hath this property, not only to be violent in its deſires, but to be terminated to one object; I muſt have food, ſays an hungry man, and nothing but food will pleaſe him; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him Muſick, no, that will not content him; offer him Gold and Silver, that will not content him; he muſt have food, and nothing in the World but food will content and ſatisfie him. So that Soul that hath a true deſire after Chriſt, ſays, I muſt have Chriſt, and none but Chriſt will content me; Riches, Pleaſures, Honours will not ſatisfie my Soul: I muſt have Chriſt, none but Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And are your deſires conſtant, and continued deſires? It may be ſome men may have flaſhes of deſires, when their Conſciences are awakened, when they lie tumbling upon a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, or when the wrath of God begins to be kindled againſt them: But tell me, Are thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires conſtant? Canſt thou ſay with <hi>David, My ſoul breaketh for the longing it hath unto thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at all times?</hi> Pſalm 119.20. I know there may be an intermiſſion of the act of deſire, but then the conſtant bent of the Soul is Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. As a Tradeſman, that makes it his T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> to buy and ſell, though he doth not always buy and ſell; ſo the Soul will be always trading in deſire for Chriſt, though there may be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:45614:166"/>Thirdly, Are they induſtrious deſires, that make you not only to deſire him, but to ſeek him? <hi>The deſire of our Soul is to thy Name, O Lord, and to the remembrance of thee.</hi> And then, <hi>With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night; yea, with my Spirit will I ſeek thee early,</hi> Iſa. 26.8, 9. If ſo be your deſires after Chriſt be right, they will put you upon all means of Grace, and the uſing of them carefully, and conſcientiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after him, and following of him in the uſe of every Ordinance. This is the firſt way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may know whether Chriſt be precious to you; See what your deſires are: if they be ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried out after Chriſt, if they be vehement, conſtant and induſtrious deſires.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Would you know whether Jeſus Chriſt be precious to your Souls, yea or no? then ſee whether your love to Jeſus Chriſt be a true love, unfeigned love; whether you love him in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, or no? <hi>Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity, Amen,</hi> Epheſ. 6. <hi>ult.</hi> Implying, many love him not in ſincerity. Thus you may know, whether you love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You will remember Chriſt, your hearts will be much taken up with him; <hi>When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches,</hi> Pſalm. 63.6. Are your thoughts taken up with him?</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you love him in ſincerity, you will hold no correſpondency with ſin: you will hate ſin, and hate every ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If your love to Chriſt be ſincere, it will be accompanied with ſmarting ſorrow for your former unkindneſſes to him; as <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:45614:166"/>becauſe ſhe loved much, ſhe wept much. Thus will ſuch a Soul ſay, <hi>Againſt thee have I ſinned, thee have I offended; with Judas I have betrayed thee, though thou didſt never ſhed thy blood for him, as thou didſt for me; therefore my ſins are the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe againſt thee I have ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Would you know whether Chriſt be precious to you, or no? let me then propound to you theſe three Soul-ſearching Queſtions:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, Tell me, What are you willing to give for Chriſt?</item>
                  <item>Secondly, What are you willing to loſe for Chriſt?</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, What pains are you willing to take that you may obtain him?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, If you would know whether Chriſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to you, then anſwer this Queſtion, What are you willing to give for Chriſt? I know nothing can be given by way of merit, do not underſtand me ſo; but what are you willing to give in the uſe of means?</p>
            <p>Firſt, Are you willing to give as much for Chriſt now, as you would give in a time of ſickneſs, when you are lying upon your Death-beds: when the Soul ſits upon the lips, and is ready to take its leave? Are you willing to give as much now in health, as you would give in a time of ſickneſs? Oh, when a man lies on his ſick-bed, and Death knocks at his door, Chriſt then, it may be, would be very precious to him: Oh what would he then give for a Chriſt? Thoſe in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver regarded the Ark all the while it was a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: yet when the Flood came, what would they have given for an Ark then? What would you give for Chriſt at that time when you are upon a Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:45614:167"/>ready to be delivered by your Death-bed, to your cold Grave? Certainly, Chriſt is as precious now, as he will be when you lie upon a ſick-bed, when you ſhall look Death in the face.</p>
            <p>Again, Are you willing to give as much for Chriſt now, as at the day of Judgment? Oh what ſeeking and ſuing will there be to Chriſt at that day! Lord, pity me; Lord, own me, I am undone for ever without thee. Oh what ſeeking and ſuing will there be to Chriſt at that day! Certainly, Chriſt is as precious now as he will be at that day, when <hi>he ſhall come in Flames of fire, taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them that know him not, and obey not his Goſpel,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.8. Can you be content to give as much for him now, as you would give in that day for him? Can you be contented to give as much for him, as a damned Soul would give for him, if it were poſſible he could purchaſe him? Certainly he is as precious now, as he would be to a damned ſoul, if he could be made partaker of him.</p>
            <p>In a word, Tell me, Are you willing to give up your ſelves to him, wholly to be ruled by him? to give up your Underſtandings to him, <hi>to deſire to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified?</hi> To give up your Will to him: to ſay, Rule in me as thou pleaſeſt, ſo I may be but thine? to give up your Affections to him, to love him, to delight in him, to rejoyce in him; to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>God ſorbid I ſhould rejoyce in any thing, ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.14. If you can do thus, then you have anſwered the firſt Queſtion, and you may know certainly, Jeſus Chriſt is precious to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:45614:167"/>Secondly, Tell me, What are you willing to loſe for Chriſt, to part with for a precious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer?</p>
            <p>Firſt, Are you willing to part with your ſins, though they may be never ſo near and dear to you, though they be as your right hand and right eye? can you throw them away from you with deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.22, <hi>Ye ſhall defile alſo the covering of your graven Image, and the Ornament of thy mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Image of gold; thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſtruous cloth, thou ſhalt ſay unto it, get thee hence;</hi> they ſhall caſt away their Idols with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation.</p>
            <p>Again, Can you be content to part with the World, your Eſtates, your Liberties, your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, any thing for Chriſt? Underſtand me thus:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, If they come in competition with him.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, If they ſtand in oppoſition to him.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, If they come in competition with him: Tell me, can you hate Father, Mother, Wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, any thing that is near and dear to you, if it ſtand in competition with Chriſt? or any thing that ſtands in oppoſition to him? If any thing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the meeting of Chriſt and your Souls, though never ſo near and dear to you, can you caſt it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? can you be content to part with it?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Anſwer me this Queſtion, What pains can you be contented to take for the gaining of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? can you be as induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unwearied in the purſuit of thoſe unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches that are laid up in Chriſt, as you are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe temporary and tranſitory riches, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes take to themſelves wings and fly away? can you be as unſatiable, in ſeeking to gain Jeſus Chriſt on the Lords Day, as you are unwearied in
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:45614:168"/>your Callings on the Week day? certain it is, if Jeſus Chriſt be precious to you, you will think no pains too great: you will think no coſt too much, you will think no induſtry can be great enough for the purchaſing this Pearl of Price; you will, with the Wiſe Merchant in the Goſpel, ſell all to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe him; you will ſeek him in the Streets, as the Spouſe did; you will ſeek him in the Aſſemblies: you will be driving a Trade ſtill, that you may get more of him: more influences of Grace from him, and more conformity unto him. This is the firſt Uſe of <hi>Examination,</hi> to diſcover whether Jeſus Chriſt be precious to you, or no; if your deſires be ſtrongly carried out after him, if your love be a ſervent and ſincere love; if you can be content to give any thing for him, and to loſe or part with any thing for his ſake: and if you can be content to take any pains, and think no pains too great to gain him, who is the Pearl of great Price. The Lord make your own hearts your Judges in this particular. And ſo much for the firſt Uſe of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. There are three other Uſes: a Uſe of Conviction, a Uſe of Information, and a Uſe of Exhortation: But I muſt refer them to another opportunity.</p>

            <p>I Have ſpoken to this Text in two Sermons already, upon the like occaſion of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn approaching to the Table of the Lord; and there are two Points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I have drawn from theſe words: the firſt is this, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is infinitely precious in himſelf.</hi> The ſecond is this, <hi>As Jeſus Chriſt is infinitely precious in himſelf, ſo is he alſo precious to all Believers, and highly prized by them.</hi> This Point I ſpake to upon the laſt Occaſion, and opened it to you, and made one Uſe of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I now come to a ſecond Uſe: that is, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction: If it be ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt is thus preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all Believers: then it follows, few, yea very few Believers there are in the World; nay, very few of thoſe that do profeſs the Name of Chriſt; becauſe there are very few that do prize him, very few that make that high account of him, as becomes ſo rich, ſo precious, ſo invaluable a Redeemer.</p>
            <p>But it may be you will ſay to me, Who are they then that do not prize Jeſus Chriſt? who are they that do not value him? I ſhall inſtance in four or five ſorts of Perſons:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:45614:169"/>Firſt, They do not prize the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ſee no beauty in him that they ſhould deſire him; that ſee no beauty in ſpiritual things, no beauty in Grace, no beauty in the peace of a good conſcience, no beauty in Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, in righteouſneſs and holineſs: for in theſe things conſiſts the Kingdom of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17, <hi>For the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now thoſe that ſee no beauty in thoſe things that lead the Soul to Chriſt, in thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Kingdom of Chriſt conſiſts: certainly they do not prize Chriſt. This is the great fault of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for which they were rejected, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretold, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2, 3, <hi>He ſhall grow up before him as a tender Plant, and as a Root out of a day ground; he hath no form, nor comelineſs; and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him. He is deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt with a carnal eye, they look upon his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, the meanneſs of his Birth; born in a Stable, the lowneſs of his Parentage: the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> being at that time but like the ſtump of a Tree, a dry Root: he coming from the Root of <hi>Jeſſe;</hi> they look upon his attendance, a company of poor Fiſhermen: they look upon his condition, not having a Houſe to lay his Head in, therefore they ſlight him, reject him, and deſpiſe him. Juſt thus it is at this day; many there are that value not at all ſpiritual things, neither value they the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; <hi>The Kingdom of God cometh not with obſervation,</hi> (Luke 17.20.) it cometh not
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:45614:169"/>with outward Pomp and Splendour; it comes not with obſervation, becauſe it is a hidden Kingdom, a ſpiritual Kingdom: inward Faith, and Love, and ſelf-denial, and other inward Graces, becauſe theſe are the things belonging to the Kingdom of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and being not obvious to carnal eyes, therefore they ſee no beauty in them. Therefore this is a plain token they ſee no beauty in Chriſt; they that ſee no beauty in Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in his Ordinances, and in his Spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, certainly they ſee no beauty in Chriſt: There wants no beauty in him, but carnal men want eyes to behold him: certainly, ſpiritual things they are the moſt precious and invaluable Commodities that are; therefore becauſe thou feeſt no beauty in Heaven, and in heavenly things, ſpiritual things, the graces of the Spirit, and the comſorts of the Spirit, thou art one that doſt not prize the Lord Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They do not prize the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that prefer their luſts before him, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the wills of the Fleſh, and of the Mind, as the <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifies, <hi>before him,</hi> in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. Thoſe that ſay in their hearts, though it may be they will not ſpeak it with their mouths, but it is the language of their hearts, <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us: we will walk in our own crooked ways, and not in the ways of Chriſt, in the ways of holineſs.</hi> Certainly, they that prefer their luſts before him, they do not prize him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They that do not prize the Meſſengers of Jeſus Chriſt, they do not prize Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: So ſays our Saviour himſelf expreſly, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16, ſpeaking to his Diſciples, and in them to his ſucceding Miniſters: <hi>He that heareth you, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:45614:170"/>me, and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> When <hi>Hannun</hi> the King of the children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> caſt contempt on the Meſſengers and Ambaſſadors of <hi>David,</hi> and ſo wickedly entreated them, by cutting off their Garments in the middle to their buttocks, and ſhaving off the one half of their Beards, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10; it was a plain token that he deſpiſed <hi>David</hi> alſo, becauſe he deſpiſed his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They do not prize the Lord Chriſt, that can keep the beſt room they have, I mean their hearts, for creature-comforts, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as I may ſay with reverence, is thruſt into the Stable. But you will ſay, How does that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? Thus; when a mans Liberty, or Eſtate, or Friends, or outward reputation come to be hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if Chriſt be owned: that man now that can prefer any of his creature-accommodations, rather than run any hazard for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that man does not prize Chriſt. When it comes to a point, that a man muſt part with ſome, or all of his comforts and accommodation, rather than part with his Saviour; that man that can part with his Saviour rather than his comforts, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that man does not prize Chriſt. Thus was it with the <hi>Gadarens:</hi> when it came to the Point, that they muſt part with their Swine, or with Jeſus Chriſt, they would part with Chriſt, rather than with their Swine.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They that do not prize his Ordinances, that do not keep cloſe to him, &amp; to his way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; thoſe that do not ſet their hearts and ſouls to ſeek him, to ſeek his Truth, to ſeek his Face, to rejoyce in his Love, to content and ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:45614:170"/>in him; to ſay, If I have but Jeſus Chriſt, though I be as poor as <hi>Job</hi> upon the Dunghil, yet I am rich enough; certainly, theſe do prize the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Oh that we could learn to be true to our own Souls, and to love our ſelves ſo well, as not to beguile our own Souls in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end. That's the ſecond Uſe of Conviction.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A third Uſe is this: If Chriſt be thus precious to all true Believers, then there are theſe three or four Leſſons, or Doctrinal Inferences that may be gathered from this concluſion, or point of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If Jeſus Chriſt be ſo precious to Believers, then it follows, that Faith is an exceeding rich and precious Grace: it is called <hi>precious Faith,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1, <hi>Simon Peter, a Servant, and an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, to them that have obtained like precious Faith with us, through the righteouſneſs of God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But why is Faith ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Grace? becauſe it makes Chriſt ſo precious to our Souls, it makes a man look upon Chriſt with an admiring eye, it raviſhes the Soul with the love of this precious Redeemer; and it makes him break out and ſay, There is no Beloved like my Beloved; Oh the Dignity of his Perſon! Oh the Vertue of his Blood! Oh the value of his Sufferings! Oh the ſweetneſs of his Graces! Oh the Comforts of his Spirit! Oh the excellency of thoſe glorious and tranſcendent Hopes that are laid up in him! You read of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he ſcorned all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Egypt;</hi> Why? becauſe <hi>by Faith he beheld him that was inviſible,</hi> Heb. 11.26, 27. By the eye of Faith he lookt upon Jeſus Chriſt, and he ſaw more beauty in him, than in all the Treaſures of <hi>Egypt;</hi> more ſweetneſs in one ſmile of his Face,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:45614:171"/>than in ten thouſand Worlds: Oh therefore that you and I could learn to trade for Faith more a great deal than for the World: Oh let us trade for this rich and precious Grace; look out for Faith, and long for Faith, and ſtrive to believe; for until this Grace of Faith be planted in your hearts, Jeſus Chriſt and you are ſtrangers, Chriſt and you ſtand at a very great diſtance: but as ſoon as ever Faith is planted in the Soul, then there is inſtantly a cloſing with Chriſt, as quick a cloſing between Chriſt and the Soul, as there is between the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and the Iron: the Soul preſently cloſes with him, and cleaves to him, as ſoon as ever it begins to believe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If Jeſus Chriſt be ſo prrcious to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, then learn this Leſſon, by way of Inference, <hi>That Believers are rich and honourable Perſons:</hi> Why? <hi>becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is to them both Riches and Honour.</hi> I gather this from the ſignification of the word in the <hi>Greek</hi> Text: Jeſus Chriſt is both a Price and an Honour to his, for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies both a Price and Honour: Jeſus Chriſt therefore is a Price to Believers, he is a Pearl to them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is a Pearl of ineſtimable Price to all thoſe that have got an intereſt in him; this Pearl of Price is better worth than ten thouſand worlds: by him we are enriched in all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5, <hi>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the Grace of God which is given you by Jeſus Chriſt, that in every thing ye are enriched by him.</hi> And you read of the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me, who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, is this Grace given, that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the uſearchable Riches of Chriſt.</hi> O when
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:45614:171"/>a man once is gotten into Chriſt, his Riches cannot be told: he hath the Riches of Redemption, the Riches of Chriſts Merits, the Riches of Chriſts Spirit, and he hath the rich and glorious Purchaſe of Chriſts blood; he hath all theſe for his portion, he may ſay all theſe are mine: and can you name ſuch Riches as theſe are? they are called <hi>unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Riches: Eye hath not ſeen, Ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of Man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> what thoſe unſearchable Riches are which a Believer receives by Chriſt; therefore a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is infinitely Rich.</p>
            <p>And then, A Believer is truly honourable by him: the Lord Chriſt is not only a Price, but an Honour to him; he is a moſt glorious Redeemer; Nay, Chriſt is not only glorious, but he is called Glory it ſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.5, <hi>And the Glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee it together, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it:</hi> that is, Chriſt ſhall be revealed. The Prophet declares, that <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> ſpeaking of the coming of Chriſt, ſays, <hi>The Glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee it together:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is called there <hi>the Glory of the Lord.</hi> So in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament he is called <hi>the glory of his People;</hi> Luke 2.32, <hi>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of thy people Iſrael.</hi> Indeed, no Glory can be put upon any one like this, to be a Member of Chriſt, to be the Spouſe of Chriſt, to be the Servant of Chriſt. <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that good Emperor, eſteemed it a greater honour to be <hi>Servus Chriſti,</hi> than <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Regni;</hi> a greater honour to be a Servant to Chriſt, than to be Head of the Empire.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Learn this Leſſon, by way of Inference, If Jeſus Chriſt be ſo precious to Believers, then
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:45614:172"/>certainly, Unbelief is a moſt dangerous, a moſt damnable, a Soul-deſtroyiug ſin; why? becauſe Unbelief makes Jeſus Chriſt to be of no worth, no value, no price, no advantage at all. <hi>To you that do believe, he is precious:</hi> I, but ſays the Apoſtle, in the next words to the Text, <hi>To them which be diſobedient:</hi> that is, to them that do not believe, <hi>he is a Stone of ſtumbling, a Rock of Offence;</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is as a thing of nought; it is the Apoſtles own expreſſion; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the Rulers, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.11, <hi>This is the Stone which was ſet at nought by you builders, which is become the Head of the Corner.</hi> They made nothing of Chriſt. To an Unbeliever Chriſt is of no more worth, than the dirt under his foot, with Reverence be it ſpoken. An Unbeliever, he would ſell Chriſt for thirty pieces of Silver, with <hi>Judas:</hi> nay, he will prefer five ſhillings before him. Of all ſins, take heed of this ſin: for this is the evil heart that is departing from the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12, <hi>Take heed Brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</hi> Hereby the Soul begins to depart, to depart, to depart, till at laſt it hears that dreadful Sentence, <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> As Faith is the firſt return of the Soul to God, ſo Unbelief is the firſt departing of the Soul from God; take heed therefore of Unbelief.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another Leſſon by way of Inference, is this, If Jeſus Chriſt be ſo precious to thoſe that do believe in him, O how infinitely precious will he be to them that do enjoy him? If he be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them that ſee him by the eye of Faith, how infinitely precious will he be to them that ſee him
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:45614:172"/>face to face, when our Faith is brought into frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our hope into our hand! <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Jeſus Chriſt afar off: he faw him when he was to come, two thouſand years before he came into the World; <hi>Abraham</hi> by an eye of Faith faw him, and he rejoyced; the Text ſays, <hi>John</hi> 8.56, <hi>Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> If he ſaw him when he was at ſuch a diſtance, and rejoyced; how does <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoyce now, when he ſees him face to face! Long for that time, when you ſhall have a full ſight of him, which is called <hi>The Beatifical Viſion;</hi> that is the Viſion that will make you everlaſtingly bleſſed. One ſight of Jeſus Chriſt in Glory, will ſo ſatisfie the Soul, ſo beautifie it, ſo rejoyce it, <hi>that</hi> (it is an expreſſion that <hi>Auſtin</hi> uſed) <hi>if ſo be a man were in Hell, if you could ſuppoſe ſuch a thing to be, and had but one glimpſe of the Beatifical Viſion, it would ſwallow up all the bitterneſs of Hell it ſelf.</hi> And this is that which Chriſt hath both promiſed and prayed for; he hath promiſed, <hi>We ſhall ſee him as he is:</hi> and he hath prayed for it too, <hi>John</hi> 17.24, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, be with me where I am, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my Glory, which thou haſt given me, for thou lovedſt me before the foundation of the world.</hi> Oh long for that day when you ſhall ſee Jeſus Chriſt as he is, ſee him in his Glory; then he will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely and unconceivably precious indeed, and that to all Eternity. That's the third Uſe of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> in theſe four Leſſons, That Faith is a moſt precious Grace; That Believers are rich and Honourable Perſons; That Unbelief is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and damnable, and Soul-deſtroying ſin; and that the ſight of Jeſus Chriſt face to face in
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:45614:173"/>Glory, will be infinitely and unconceivably preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and glorious indeed.</p>
            <p>A fourth <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> it is for <hi>Exhortation.</hi> If Jeſus Chriſt be ſo precious to Believers: then let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, and perſwade you, and prevail with you, and the Lord bow your hearts to hearken to this <hi>Exhortation</hi> this day. As ever you deſire to have a certain proof and evidence that you are true Believers, and that you are true Members of Jeſus Chriſt, and that you are real Saints (for there are many nominal, but there are but few true Saints) that you are true Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, and truly united to him, and have communion with him, and have infinite precious priviledges by him; O then do you learn to prize Jeſus Chriſt at a high rate, ſet a high price upon this precious Redeemer; let him be higheſt in your eſteem; do your labour every day, that he may be more and more precious, and amiable, and beautiful in your eyes: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber but that ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26, <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple. He that does not hate Father,</hi> &amp;c Theſe words muſt not be underſtood ſimply, as if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our would have us to hate our Relations, as Father, Mother, Wife, Children, and Brethren, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and our own lives: certainly that is not the meaning of the words of our Saviour, that he would have us to offer violation to the Law of Nature; it is not ſpoken therefore ſimply, but comparatively: he that does not love me ſo much, ſo as to hate all other in compariſon of me: he that does not prize me before Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Brethren, Houſe, Lands, yea, life it ſelf,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:45614:173"/>and all things that are deſirable, ſuch a one hath no intereſt in me, and ſhall have no benefit by me. Now becauſe it is an <hi>Exhortation</hi> of ſuch infinite concernment, therefore I ſhall divide it into three Branches.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew you the manner how you ſhould prize Chriſt.</item>
               <item>Secondly, The Motives which may perſwade you to it.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, The means that may help you in it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, For the manner how you muſt prize Chriſt. It may be you will ſay, <hi>In what manner muſt we prize Chriſt? In what manner muſt Chriſt be precious to us?</hi> Prize him in your Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in your Choice, in your Affections, and in his Ordinances.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In your Underſtandings, deſiring <hi>to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2, <hi>And count all things but droſs and dung, in compariſon of the excellency of the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Indeed, there is a thouſand times more worth, and beauty, and ſweetneſs, and excellency in Jeſus Chriſt, than you can know; as he ſaid, <hi>That man that knows Jeſus Chriſt well, although he be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of all other things, he is the right knowing man.</hi> If a man had all the learning of both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities concentred in himſelf, and yet ignorant of Jeſus Chriſt, he were but a poor ſimple Sot.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Prize Jeſus Chriſt in your Choice, to pitch upon him as the adequate Object, ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Object of your Souls; pitch upon him as the only excellent one. As a woman that ſelects and ſingles out one man from amongſt all the reſt, upon whom ſhe places all her Affections for her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; ſo do you ſelect and chuſe out Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:45614:174"/>for your Beloved, and ſay, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none on Earth that I deſire in compariſon of thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Prize Jeſus Chriſt in your Affections; love him above all expreſſions of love: labour to be ſick of love towards ſo ſweet and precious a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as the Spouſe was, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.5, <hi>Stay me with Flaggons, Comfort me with Apples, for I am ſick of love:</hi> ſaying as <hi>David</hi> did, in that mournful Elegy which he made for <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan;</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Thy love to me was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, paſſing the love of women,</hi> 2 Sam. 1.26, <hi>I am diſtreſſed for thee my brother Jonathan, very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant haſt thou been unto me, thy love to me was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, paſſing the love of women.</hi> —Then truſt in him as the Rock of your Salvation: truſt to his Wiſdom to lead you, in his Power to ſupport you; truſt in his Mercy and Merit to ſave you.—Again, Do you rejoyce in him? to ſay as the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> did, <hi>My Soul doth magnifie the Lord, and my Spirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour.</hi>—And cleave to him, as to that Rock that only can deliver you, both from the raging Ocean of Gods everlaſting diſpleaſure, and from the leaking boat of your own graces: prize him in your Affections.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Prize him in his Ordinances, in his Word; <hi>Oh how ſweet is thy Word, O Lord,</hi> that brings me good tidings of a bleſſed Redeemer! The Word of God is as a Letter ſent from a dear and precious Husband to his Wife. And prize him in the Sacraments, which is as a Love token or Ring ſent to you from the Beloved of your Souls: Oh how ſhould you prize theſe Ordinances! In the Sacrament, by an eye of Faith, you may ſee him bleeding, and pouring out his Soul an offering
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:45614:174"/>for ſin; in the Sacrament, you may ſee him cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dying for your ſakes: in a word, eſteem one hours communion with him, better worth than all the pleaſures in the World, as that Noble Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Italy</hi> did; who ſaid, <hi>He was not worthy of Chriſt, that did not eſteem one hours Communion with him, better than all the treaſures in the World.</hi> So much for the manner, how we muſt prize Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the Motives that may perſwade you to it; and Oh, that I knew what Motives might raiſe up your eſteem of this precious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; I will name but theſe three:</p>
            <p>Will either worth, or beauty or excellency, or ſweetneſs, or Soul-ſatisfaction, win upon your hearts? all theſe are to be found in him: He is an All-ſufficient-Saviour, All-ſufficient for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his blood can pardon; All-ſufficient for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification alſo, for his blood can purifie; All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for Redemption, his blood can deliver from wrath to come. Do but conſider how precious this Chriſt is in himſelf, as I ſhewed you in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Doctrine; precious in his Perſon, precious in his Titles, precious in his Offices, being a King, Prieſt and Prophet, precious in the purchaſe of his blood.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I beſeech you to conſider, that Jeſus Chriſt is the only deſirable good. The common vote and voice of the World, is this, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> Pſalm 4.6. But why do you not ſay, Who will ſhew us Jeſus Chriſt, who is indeed the only needful good, the All-ſufficient good, the Soul-ſatisfying good? aſſure your ſelves, nothing under Heaven can do you good without him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under Heaven can be good if you want him;
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:45614:175"/>what are Riches without Jeſus Chriſt? what is Gold and Silver without Jeſus Chriſt, but rotten ſtinking dung? what are the moſt Royal Robes that ever were put on by the greateſt Emperour, without Jeſus Chriſt? what are they but poluted clouts? what is the moſt Princely Palace without Jeſus Chriſt, but a Peſt-houſe? what is Birth, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, Education, without Jeſus Chriſt, but glittering ſins? So your choiceſt comforts and accommodations without Jeſus Chriſt, they are no better than gilded damnation: what are all your outward Bleſſings without Chriſt? no better than curſes. And as nothing is good without him, ſo nothing can do you good without him; there is no creature in Heaven or Earth that can do you good without Chriſt, neither Men nor Angels: if you had all the Angels in Heaven to ſpeak for you, they could do you no good without Chriſt; God himſelf will do you no good without Chriſt, he will not (if I may uſe ſuch an expreſſion) truck or trade with you, he will not exchange one word in the buſineſs of Salvation, but by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.6, <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi> You cannot have any acceſs to God, approach to him, to ſtand up for your lives, or the life of your Souls, without him who is the life of your lives, and the Soul of your Souls: Pray tell me therefore, Are you contented to periſh for ever in your ſins? Are you contented that the curſes and threatnings of the Law, thoſe Treaſures of wrath, that they ſhould be your portion? Are you contented to be baniſhed from the preſence of God, and to be ſent into a dungeon of darkneſs; there to be, and to be moſt miſerable is all one?
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:45614:175"/>Are you contented to be ſent to <hi>that blackneſs of darkneſs for ever?</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Jude</hi> 12. I know you are not: Oh then, why do you not prize Jeſus Chriſt, by whom alone it is that you may eſcape eternal wrath and vengeance? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. <hi>Why do you ſpend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which will not ſatisfie?</hi> Why do you trifle away your time in impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in things that will not profit? why do you pour out your hearts on every luſt and vanity, and in the mean time neglect him who only can give you remiſſion of ſin, and a right to the Promiſes, and reconciliation with God, and Eternal Salvation?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let me uſe one Motive more. Do but conſider how infinitely precious the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is to God the Father! O what account does he make of him! He eſteem him the Son of his Love, the Son of his Boſom, the Delight of his Soul, <hi>My Servant in whom my Soul delighteth.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was both a Son and a Servant in our fleſh, when he took our Nature, and became our Surety, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, <hi>Behold my Servant whom I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Gentiles.</hi> What account do the Saints in Heaven make of Chriſt? they look upon him as the life of their lives, and the Soul of their Souls: as the heaven of their Happineſs, as the joy of their Joy; the Heaven that the Saints now enjoy, it is the beholding of Jeſus Chriſt now in Glory. Nay, do but conſider what account Sinners will make of him; they that now ſlight him, that prefer every baſe luſt before him, that mind the getting of every thing but Chriſt; Oh what account will they make at that great day, when they ſhall call to
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:45614:176"/>the Mountains fall on them, and the Hills to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them! Oh what would they give for a ſmile of his face at that day: when, if they had ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Worlds in their poſſeſſion, they would give it for a ſmile of his face! Will Chriſt be ſo precious hereafter, and ſhall he not be precious now? will not theſe Motives work upon you? are they jeſts and fables? If, my Brethren, ſuch Arguments will not prevail, for my part I am out of hope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let me but ſhew you ſome Means that may help you to prize the Lord Chriſt, to make him precious to your Souls. The Means or Helps, briefly, are theſe four or five:</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Soul muſt be convinced of the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable need that it hath of Jeſus Chriſt; it is neceſſity that does inhance the price: for till the Soul be convinced of this, all the Arguments and Motives that we can uſe, are but like water that runs beſides the Bottle, becauſe the Bottle is ſtopt: all our Arguments prevail nothing, they take no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the heart at all: but when a Soul once ſees, either I muſt have Chriſt, or I muſt periſh for ever, I am loſt, damned, and undone for ever, I am a fire-brand of Hell for ever; O Chriſt is now Chriſt indeed to ſuch a Soul. If ever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you deſire to prize him according to his worth, be much in the duty of ſelf-examination: turn your eyes inward, to ſee the vileneſs of your Natures, the ſinfulneſs of your hearts, and the manifold tranſgreſſions of your lives; reaſon thus with thy own Soul: What am I by Nature, but a child of Wrath, and an heir of Hell, and a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave to Satan: a ſtranger to God, and an enemy to him, without God, and without Hope? the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:45614:176"/>of my ſins are more than the hairs of my head, my heart fails me in the remembrance of them: and one ſin is enough to ſink me into Hell, becauſe it is committed againſt an infinite Majeſty, and therefore it deſerves an infinite puniſhment: for, where God does puniſh, he does puniſh infinitely, his Juſtice muſt have an infinite ſatisfaction: and there is no ſatisfaction can be given to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22, <hi>For without blood there is no remiſſion,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; and no blood can expiate ſin, can take away the guilt of ſin, but the blood of an infinite value; and no blood is of an infinite value, but the blood of this precious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that is that blood that is of invaluable and unconceivable worth; for, for the Son of God to ſhed his blood, it is more than if all the Angels in Heaven, and Potentates of the Earth had laid down their lives to purchaſe one of our Souls: therefore I muſt have this blood ſprinkled on my Soul, or elſe I muſt reſolve to periſh everlaſtingly; conſider therefore of the need that you have of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Do you deſire to prize Jeſus Chriſt? then labour to eat this bleſſed Paſsover with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter herbs: I mean, labour to partake of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with the bitter remembrance of all your former unkindneſſes: all your miſcarriages, failings, wandrings, and back-ſlidings; Oh let the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of theſe be as bitter to you as Gall and Wormwood: Oh labour to ſay feelingly, <hi>It is an evil and bitter thing that thou haſt provoked the Lord,</hi> (Jer. 2.19.) that thou haſt grieved his Spirit, that thou haſt forfeited his Love, that thou haſt abuſed his kindneſs, that thou haſt turned his grace into wantonneſs; O ſay, I have done enough
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:45614:177"/>a thouſand, and a thouſand times to damn my Soul, if the mercy of God were one jot leſs than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; if the blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould not quench the fire of his anger, it would be burning, and burning, and burning againſt me to all Eternity, even as long as God ſhall be God; it is a bitter thing that I have provoked my God. You ſhould in this Sacrament <hi>look upon him whom you have pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and mourn over him, as one that mourns for the loſs of his only Son; and be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt-born</hi> (Zech. 12.10.) that is the Image of his Perſon, and is as it were the prop and ſtay of his Family. This is certain, my Brethren, there are none that do prize Jeſus Chriſt ſo much, as they that are ſtung with the ſenſe of their own ſinfulneſs, of their own vileneſs; none prize the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſo much, as they that moſt of all feel the burthen of their own ſins. Let me give you two remarkable examples: the one of a man, the other of a woman. Did ever man prize Jeſus Chriſt more than St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his Excellencies but as dirt under his feet, in compariſon of Chriſt? he did eſteem them as things that we caſt to Dogs, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies? Did ever woman prize Jeſus Chriſt more than <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> who you know, waſht his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head? What is the reaſon that St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> prized Jeſus Chriſt ſo much? the reaſon is, Becauſe they were ſo exceeding ſenſible of the bitterneſs of ſin. <hi>Paul</hi> he cryes out, <hi>I am of all ſinners the greateſt.</hi> And <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> you know was one out of whom was caſt ſeven Devils, a notorious Sinner; now ſhe being ſenſible of her ſins, this made her <hi>love much, becauſe much was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:45614:177"/>her,</hi> Luke 7.47. Take it for a Rule, they that ſlight their ſin, will quickly ſlight a Saviour; where ſin is ſlighted, a Saviour will be ſlighted alſo; where ſin is a burden, and where it is bitter, there Jeſus Chriſt will be very ſweet; the bitterneſs of ſin adds a relliſh to the ſweetneſs of Chriſt. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eat this Paſsover with bitter herbs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Then get your hearts unglewed from the World: I do not ſay, quite caſt off your care of Earthly things: but this I ſay, the world ſhould not have ſo much of your hearts: ſet your feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World, ſet your hearts upon Jeſus Chriſt. Carnal men are ſo glewed to the World, and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, that it is as hard a matter for them to be pulled from it, as you find a ſucking child is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with a full Breaſt: O therefore uſe the World as if ſo be you uſed it not.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Then ſtudy his Excellency, his Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his Perfection: ſtudy the unſearchableneſs of the Promiſes, <hi>All the promiſes of God are in him Yea, and in him Amen;</hi> Study the unſearchable Riches of the covenant of Grace: as Juſtification, Sanctification, and Adoption, which all come ſtreaming in his blood; Oh that you would ſtudy theſe more than you do. What is the reaſon we prize Chriſt ſo little? it is becauſe we know ſo little of him; if we knew him more, we ſhould love him more, and prize him more, and cleave to him more.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the fifth and laſt place: Do you deſire to prize Jeſus Chriſt? beg earneſtly that God would open your eyes to ſee more of his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and give you hearts to taſte more of his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: that you may ſay, <hi>Lord ſhew me thy Glory, and it ſufficeth;</hi> Oh, one glimpſe of thy favour,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:45614:178"/>how ſweet and precious will it be to me! Says our Saviour to the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> John 4.10, <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God,</hi> if thou didſt but know me, the greateſt gift that ever God did beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſons of men: then, if thou kneweſt me, <hi>Thou wouldſt have asked of me living water.</hi> If you did but know Jeſus Chriſt, you would open your eyes to ſee more of him, and love him, and prize him more and more.</p>
            <p>The laſt Uſe it is for <hi>Conſolation;</hi> If Jeſus Chriſt be ſo precious to all Believers: then here is a word of Conſolation and Encouragement to all you that do prize him, to all you that do ſet your hearts upon him, to all you that do reſolve to make him your Portion, your Husband, your Head, your Rock, your Redeemer, your All.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Can you ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, <hi>I rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh?</hi> I can rejoyce in nothing in compariſon of him: neither Riches, nor Honours, nor Parts, nor Parentage, nor in any of theſe outward poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: O they are nothing to me in compariſon of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Art thou one that canſt ſay, I can be contented to beg with him, to die with him, to die for him, to be under any reproach, or diſgrace, to ſuffer any loſs, ſo I may but gain him for my Portion?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Art thou one that doſt ſtudy more conformity to him, as well as Communion with him: deſiring to be <hi>holy, as he is holy;</hi> to have his Image ſtampt more and more upon thy Soul?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Art thou one that deſireſt to be Ruled by him, as well as to be Redeemed by him? <hi>O Lord, Rule in me as thou pleaſeſt, ſo I may be but
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:45614:178"/>thine;</hi> I would be under thy Dominion, under thy Government; Lord, ſhew me the way thou wouldſt have me to walk in:
<q>Then know this for thy Comfort: it is a ſign that thou haſt a Spouſe-like affection in thee to Jeſus Chriſt, it is a token that Chriſt is dear to thee, that Chriſt lies near thy Soul indeed; and know this for thy Comfort, thou that prizeſt Chriſt here, thou ſhalt enjoy him for thy Portion to all Eternity hereafter, where he ſhall be Light to thine eyes, and Muſick to thine ears, and Comfort to thy ſoul, unſpeakable Comfort to thy heart: and thou ſhalt be ſatisfied with his fulneſs, when thou ſhalt have thy Soul bathed in thoſe Rivers of pleaſure that are at the right hand of God to all Eternity. O that you would think of theſe things, and lay them up in your hearts, and be careful to walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe Rules!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider what hath been ſpoken, and the Lord give you underſtanding in all things.</p>

               <hi>THE Lord knows who are his,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.) Namely, they whom he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to life Eternal; and when once God hath ſet his Privy Seal upon them, he will call them, and bring them home to himſelf, in what place ſoever they be, though ſcattered amongſt the Heathen: in what condition ſoever they be; whether high, or low, rich or poor, learned or unlearned; nay, though they be lock'd up under a Calling that may
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:45614:179"/>ſeem to be a bar from coming home to God: You ſhall ſometimes hear a man ſay, My calling hinders me from God and Goodneſs; but I would ſay to ſuch a one, if thou belongeſt to Chriſt, though thy calling be never ſo baſe and unſuitable to God, and the ways of God, yet thou ſhalt be fetch'd home, and brought home to Jeſus Chriſt at one time or other: witneſs the Jaylor here the Text ſpeaks of, that had a calling bad enough; for inſtead of profeſſing Chriſt and his Goſpel, he was a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Chriſt and his People; a rough-hewen Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that dealt hardly with theſe precious Servants of Chriſt, beating them, and putting them in the inward Priſon, and made faſt their feet in the Stocks, as you may read in the 24 <hi>verſe;</hi> but <hi>Paul and Silas ſang in Priſon,</hi> verſe 25. And take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by the way, That God can ſometimes make a Priſon a Palace to thoſe that fear him. And as they were praying, and ſinging Praiſes to God, the Lord ſhook the Priſon where they were: and with his ſhaking the Priſon, he did ſhake the Jaylors heart; he had an Earthquake within him, as well as without him: whereupon, being greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and amazed, the Text tells you here, <hi>He calls for a light, and ſprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, and brought them out, and ſaid, Sirs, What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> So that this Text tells you, and deſcribes to you the Jaylors carriage when God firſt ſtruck his heart, and gave him a ſight of himſelf, and of his ſins: and in this carriage of the Jaylor, there are theſe three things very obſervable:</p>
            <p>His Perplexity, his Courteſie, his Queſtion: his Perplexity, in <hi>verſe</hi> 29. His Courteſie and Queſtion, in <hi>verſe</hi> 30.</p>

               </item>
               <item>Secondly, His Courteſie; the Text ſays, <hi>He brought them out.</hi>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>It is the firſt of theſe I principally aim at, namely, the Jaylors Perplexity, <hi>Then he called for a light;</hi> darkneſs now was a terrour to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a terrour to himſelf, <hi>He was a Magor Miſſabib, a terrour round about,</hi> Jer. 20.3. <hi>And he ſprang in,</hi> that is, he ruſh'd haſtily into the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and like a man diſtracted, knew not what to do, nor which way to turn himſelf; <hi>he came tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> being ſtricken with inward horror, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Conſcience; and pray obſerve it well: There is not the ſtouteſt man breathing upon Earth, but if God ſet his Conſcience againſt him, like a Dog to fly in his face, it will pull him down, and lay him flat, and fill him with that inward horror and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and perplexity, that he will be more afraid of himſelf, than of all the world beſides. Thus it was with the Jaylor here: when God came nigh him, and awakened his conſcience, <hi>he fell down before Paul and Silas;</hi> God had given him a ſight of his ſins, and of the inviſible Majeſty of Chriſt, that was in thoſe his precious Servants <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> whom before he look'd upon as a couple of Rogues, and that the Whip and the Stocks were good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them: but now he reverenceth them, and reſpects them, and falls down at their feet. Thus you ſee what his Perplexity was.</p>
            <p>My purpoſe is not to inſiſt upon every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but to pitch upon that which is principally held
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:45614:180"/>forth in the words: obſerve therefore, when God was about to work the great work of ſaving Faith, and ſound Converſion in the heart of this Jaylor, and by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt to bring him to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, what is the firſt thing that he does? Firſt, he humbles him, and ſtrikes him down, and lays him flat, he doth awaken and ſhake his conſcience: this unbroken Sinner is now amazed, and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and aſtoniſhed, and he knows not which way to turn himſelf. So then the obſervation I would commend to you from the words, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Sound Humiliation is a neceſſary Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or Fore-runner to Faith and Salvation.</p>
            <p>Would you have it plainer? then take it thus:
<q>Thoſe whom God intends to make true Believers, and Heirs of his Everlaſting Kingdom: they are firſt ſoundly humbled, and made ſenſible of their own dangerous and damnable condition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Look as a Timber-tree, that a man intends for building, firſt he hews it down, and then he fits it, and ſquares it for the building; ſo that Sinner whom God intends to frame for himſelf, and build up by Faith to Salvation; God firſt caſts down to the ground, and lays him flat, and makes him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his own loſt, and dangerous, and damnable eſtate: Look into the Scripture, and you ſhall find that this is Gods Method, and Jeſus Chriſts, and the Holy Ghoſts Method.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This is Gods Method, and this courſe he took with our firſt Parents: he arraigned them, and paſt a ſentence upon them, and pronounced a curſe
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:45614:181"/>againſt them, before ever he brings them to the knowledg of a Saviour, before ever he made that Promiſe, that <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhould break the Serpents head.</hi> Remarkable is that Scripture, <hi>Job</hi> 33.21, 22; it deſcribes the manner of Gods converting a Sinner, <hi>verſe</hi> 14, <hi>God ſpeaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</hi> God calls, and cryes, and knocks, and tries this way, and that way, and the other way to bring the Sinner in, to bring him home by Converſion, but all will not do; what doth he then? Read <hi>verſe</hi> 21, 22. God humbleth the Sinner to the very duſt, <hi>His fleſh is conſumed away that it cannot be ſeen, and his bones that were not ſeen ſtick out: his ſoul draweth near unto the Grave, and his life to the deſtroyers.</hi> His meaning is this, He is made a very Anatomy, and God brings him to the very gates of Hell: and what follows, <hi>Then he is gracious unto him, and ſaith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ranſom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So this was the Method of Jeſus Chriſt; this courſe he took with St. <hi>Paul</hi> before he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: he unhorſt him, and humbled him, and ſtruck him blind; and all this while St. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt ſteep himſelf in ſorrow, before <hi>Ananias</hi> comes to him, and ſpeak words of comfort, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. Chriſt would have us <hi>weary and heavy laden,</hi> Matth. 11: weary with the work of ſin, and heavy laden with the weight of ſin, before he will give us eaſe; he will have the Soul thirſty, before he gives it the water of life, <hi>Iſa</hi> 55, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters:</hi> that is, to be ſenſible of the want of Chriſt, and the worth of Chriſt, before he gives the Soul to taſte of the water of life; and he will have the Soul ſick of ſin, before the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:45614:181"/>comes to it, <hi>The whole have no need of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, but they that are ſick,</hi> Matth. 9.12. He will have the Sinner ſick of his ſin, before he will cure him.</p>
            <p>And this is the Holy Ghoſts Method too: for you ſhall read, the Spirit of God firſt <hi>convinceth of ſin, before he convinceth of righteouſneſs,</hi> John 16.8. Firſt, The Spirit of God convinceth of ſin for humiliation, before he convinceth of righteouſneſs for Juſtification.</p>
            <p>And this hath been the Method of all Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builders. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> he comes levelling of Mountains, and caſting down proud Sinners before they come to Chriſt; and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he prick'd his Hearers to the heart, before he gave them any hope or comfort by a Saviour, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. He let them blood at the heart before he directed them how to be ſaved. But now, becauſe this is a weighty Truth, and it may pleaſe God to do good to ſome of you all the days of your lives, to know the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and manner of bringing Jeſus Chriſt and the Soul together (for this is all the work we Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have to do); let me ſpeak to it by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and ſhew you three things.</p>

            <p>Secondly, There is <hi>An Active Humiliation;</hi> and this is that whereby a Sinner humbles himſelf before God: of this you read 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.7, <hi>They have humbled themſelves, therefore I will not deſtroy them.</hi> Now it is not this latter I am to ſpeak of: this, to ſpeak properly, is nothing but the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Repentance; but I am to ſpeak of the firſt, namely, that whereby God in the firſt work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion lets a man ſee the need that he hath of Jeſus Chriſt, and it may be thus deſcribed: <hi>Pasſive hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation is a work of the Spirit of God, whereby a poor Sinner being ſtricken with a ſenſe of his ſin, and fear of wrath, doth fly out of himſelf and cloſeth with Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> I ſay, <hi>It is a work of the Spirit of God,</hi> becauſe it is the Spirit that convinceth of ſin, and by convincing of ſin, he humbles the Soul; and hence it is the Spirit of God in the firſt work of Converſion, is called <hi>the ſpirit of bondage,</hi> Rom. 8.15, <hi>For ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> Why is it called <hi>the ſpirit of bondage?</hi> not becauſe the Spirit of God brings the Soul into bondage: for the Spirit of God is a free Spirit, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.12, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>phold me with thy free Spirit; and where the Spirit of God is, there is liberty.</hi> But he is called <hi>a Spirit of bondage,</hi> becauſe he diſcovers to us our bondage, and lets the Sinner ſee the bondage and ſlavery wherein he is miſerably captivated under ſin and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:45614:182"/>Satan. A man, before the work of Converſion is wrought, thinks himſelf a Free-man; <hi>We are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams Seed, and were never in bondage to any, how ſayeſt thou we ſhall be made free?</hi> John 8.33. But now the Spirit of God comes, and lets a man ſee himſelf in the glaſs of Gods Law, whereby he diſcovers ſin to be out of meaſure ſinful; and it lets him ſee himſelf in the glaſs of Conſcience, and ſo comes to the Sinner, and ſays to him, juſt as <hi>Nathan</hi> did to <hi>David, Thou art the man;</hi> thou art he that lieth under the guilt of ſin, and under the wrath of God, and under the condemnation of the ſecond death: therefore look to it. When the Spirit of God lets a man ſee himſelf, and his bondage, and that ſtate of wo and miſery in which he is, then he confeſſeth he is in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the bond of iniquity. Again, I ſay in the deſcription of it, that <hi>the poor Sinner is ſtricken with the ſenſe of his ſin, and with the fear of wrath.</hi> Before a man is humbled, he is juſt like a man in a dead ſleep, in a drunken ſleep: he hears not, he fears not, he feels not: like the Drunkard that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.34, 35, <hi>Yea, thou ſhalt be as he that lieth down in the midſt of the Sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a Maſt; they have ſtricken me, ſhalt thou ſay, and I was not ſick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when I ſhall awake, I will ſeek it yet again.</hi> But when once the Spirit of God comes to ſtrike the Sinner to the purpoſe: now ſin is revived, and Conſcience awakened and convicted: as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was alive once without the Law;</hi> alive in my own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, alive without the ſpiritual knowledg of the Law; <hi>but ſin revived, and I died,</hi> Rom. 7.9. Then the Law ſhewed me I was but a dead man:
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:45614:183"/>O Conſcience now began to be awakened, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed. Senſe of ſin brings with it a fear of wrath: and hence it is, that the ſpirit of bondage is called <hi>a Spirit of fear,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.7, <hi>For God hath not given us the ſpirit of fear, but of Power, of Love, and of a ſound mind.</hi> And this fear doth awaken a man, and leave ſome kind of impreſſion upon the ſpirit of a man: ſo that he is awakened, and looks out for help out of himſelf. Again, I ſay, <hi>A Sinner thus ſtricken with the ſenſe of his ſin, flyes out of himſelf, and flyes to Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> That is, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairs of all hope, and help in himſelf: I dare ſay, he was never a true Believing Sinner, that was not a deſpairing Sinner: underſtand me thus, There is a Religious deſperation, as well as a damning-deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; I ſay, a Sinner that is ſtricken with the ſenſe of his ſins, deſpairs of help in himſelf; this is an holy deſpair, whereby a man renounceth all hope of help in himſelf, and flyes to Jeſus Chriſt. This is a certain Rule, The leſs a man truſts in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the more he truſts in a Saviour. That's the firſt thing, What this Humiliation is?</p>
            <p>A ſecond Queſtion to be ſatisfied is this, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like meaſure of humiliation be wrought in all thoſe that are brought home to Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, No; ſome have more, and ſome have leſs, according to the different tempers of mens ſpirits: ſome men are more froward, and ſome are more ingenious; thoſe that are openly prophane, ſtout, ſtubborn Sinners, they uſually have a great meaſure of humiliation: but now thoſe that are more flexible, have a leſs meaſure of humiliation; to the firſt, God comes like a mighty ruſhing wind; to the ſecond ſort, he comes like a ſtill wind, in a more mild and melting way; ſometimes God breaks
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:45614:183"/>in upon the Sinners heart with open violence, as he did upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was ſmitten down to the ground, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. Sometimes again God opens the heart without any noiſe, as he did the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> Acts 16. Sometimes God ſuffers a Sinner to lie long under the ſpirit of bondage, thoſe eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he hath appointed for ſome ſpecial uſe and ſervice to himſelf; as the Timber that is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome ſpecial ſervice, lies long a ſoaking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be made uſe of. Sometimes again, Sinners are ſet free from Legal terrors ſuddenly; now this is the leaſt meaſure of Humiliation, wrought in thoſe that are brought home to Jeſus Chriſt, to make ſin odious and loathſome to a man, and to make a man fly out of himſelf to Jeſus Chriſt. There is a twofold Paſſive humiliation:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>A Legal Humiliation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>An Evangelical Humiliation.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Legal humiliation, is that which conſiſts in Legal terror, and fear of wrath, and the ſenſe of Gods wrath, and horror of Conſcience, and fear of Hell-fire.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is an Evangelical humiliation, and that conſiſts in the operation of Gods bleſſed Spirit, convincing a man of ſin; when the Spirit of God convinceth the Sinner, and by convincing him, empties him of himſelf; and by emptying him, fits him for a Saviour. Legal humiliation, <hi>(Pray mark)</hi> though it makes a greater noiſe, yet it is not always abſolutely needful for all perſons, which I prove thus: It is not a grace, becauſe a man can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have too much grace, and a man may have too much Legal humiliation. Again, ſome Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:45614:184"/>have had a great meaſure of Legal humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet have periſhed; and ſome that have been converted, have had but a little meaſue of Legal humiliation, and yet have been ſaved. I ſay, Legal humiliation, though it makes a great noiſe, is not abſolutely needful: But Evangelical humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, though ir makes a leſs noiſe, this is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely needful to every perſon: becauſe this drives a Sinner out of himſelf, and cauſeth him to fly to Jeſus Chriſt in a mild and melting way, making him <hi>to look on him whom he hath pierced, and to mourn for his ſin, as he that mourns for the loſs of his only Son that ſerves him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing to be opened, is this: <hi>But why doth God take this courſe in bringing men to Faith and Salvation?</hi> The reaſons are theſe three:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, It is Equal.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, It is Fitting.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, It is Neceſſary.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, It is Equal, becauſe it is Gods way; and there is all the reaſon in the World, that God ſhould bring us to Heaven in his own way; that it is Gods way, appears <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me</hi> (ſaith Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to the meek; he hath ſent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the Captives: and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn.</hi> So you ſee they are to be comforted that mourn, and they are to be bound up that are broken-hearted; ſo that, till a man be meek and humble, and have a broken heart, he is out of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:45614:184"/>Chriſts Cnmmiſſion to comfort; Chriſt will ſay to ſuch, <hi>I have nothing to do with thee, I am ſent to thoſe that are meek, and humble, and broken-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Luke 19.10. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.11, <hi>The Son of man came to ſeek, and to ſave that which was lost.—Then</hi> (may ſome ſay) <hi>he came to ſeek and to ſave all, for all were loſt in Adam:</hi> but that is not the meaning; but the meaning is, All that feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves loſt: a man may be in a loſt condition, and yet never feel himſelf in a loſt condition; but when a man ſees himſelf to be in a loſt eſtate, and in a damned and undone condition without Chriſt, Chriſt came to ſeek and to ſave ſuch.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is Fitting that God ſhould bring us to Faith and Salvation this way: fitting, you will ſay, But how?
<list>
                  <item>In reference to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>In reference to <hi>Our ſelves.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>In reference to <hi>Others.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, In reference to <hi>God:</hi> becauſe by this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, the Juſtice of God is acknowledged, and the Mercy of God is magnified: theſe are the two great Attributes that God will have magnified in the converſion of a Sinner. The Juſtice of God is acknowledged, when the Sinner falls down at the feet of God, and ſaith, <hi>Lord, againſt thee, againſt thee have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight, that thou mighteſt be juſtified when thou ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and clear when thou judgeſt,</hi> Pſalm. 51.4. And the Mercy of God is wonderfully magnified, when he hangs out a white Flag of Pardon, after all the Sinners rebellions and provocations: O now, mercy is mercy indeed! As a King, when he is about to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:45614:185"/>pardon a Traitor, he ſuffers him to be brought to the place of Execution, to have the Rope about his neck, and the Handkerchief drawn over his face: O how welcome is a pardon then to that Traitor! So an humbled Sinner will ſay, Mercy is mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when he is convinced of his deſperate, and undone eſtate and condition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is fitting in reſpect of <hi>our ſelves:</hi> that we may know our ſelves, <hi>know the plague of our hearts,</hi> 1 Kings 8.38. God will have us to ſee and to feel, that <hi>it is an evil and bitter thing, that we have ſinned againſt him.</hi> Jer. 2 19, <hi>Thine own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy back ſlidings ſhall reprove thee; know therefore, and ſee, that it is an evil thing, and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> God would have the Sinner ſee his polution, and to cry out with the Leper under the Law: <hi>I am unclean, I am unclean,</hi> Levit. 13.45. As <hi>Miriam</hi> for her miſcarriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Moſes,</hi> was ſmitten with a Leproſie; <hi>Moſes</hi> cryed to the Lord to heal her; No, ſtay, ſaith God; <hi>If her Father had but ſpit in her face, ſhould ſhe not be aſhamed ſeven days?</hi> She muſt know her ſelf before ſhe be healed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.10, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is fitting in reſpect of <hi>Others:</hi> that they may not ſpeak reproachfully of God, and the ways of God. If ſo be a Sinner could inſtantly ſtep out of an Ale-houſe to Chriſt, or out of a Whorehouſe to Chriſt; if there were no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to get to Chriſt, than the putting of meat out of one Diſh into another, carnal men would be ready to have very low thoughts of God, that he is ſuch a one as themſelves, that he doth patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:45614:185"/>and approve their wicked courſes: but God will have the mouth of iniquity ſtop'd, and carnal men themſelves acknowledg, that the ways of God are equal.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is neceſſary that the Soul be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; I ſhall give you theſe five Reaſons of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe without this humiliation, the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can never highly prize God. To an unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sinner, Chriſt is no more eſteemed (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence be it ſpoken) than the dirt under his feet, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.11, <hi>This is the stone which was ſet at nought by you Builders:</hi> they made no reckoning of Chriſt at all. Tell an unhumbled Sinner of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, of Sanctification, of Adoption, of the hope of Glory, and the like: he makes no more reckoning of them, than the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did of the <hi>Manna,</hi> who loathed it: but now when a Sinner is ſmitten with the ſenſe of ſin, and fear of wrath, and knows the burden of guilt upon his Conſcience, now Chriſt is Chriſt indeed; and he looks upon him with an admiring eye, and cryes out, O the dignity of his Perſon! the preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Blood! the value of his Merits! the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of his Interceſſion! the comforts of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit! Oh the comforts and excellencies that are in this ſweet and precious Saviour! <hi>My Beloved</hi> (ſaith ſuch a Soul) <hi>is the choiſeſt of ten thouſand. The poor</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>receive the Goſpel;</hi> that is, thoſe that are poor in Spirit, they like the wiſe Merchant, will be contented to ſell all to buy him who is the Pearl of invaluable Price; an humbled Sinner will ſay, <hi>Give me Chriſt though I have a Croſs with him, though I have a Priſon with him; nay, though I die with him, though I die for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:45614:186"/>Secondly, Without humiliation, the Sinner can never duly and diligently ſeek Chriſt. You know, <hi>The Law is a School-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.24. The truth is, the Soul will never run to Chriſt to the purpoſe, until he be whipt by this School-maſter. You know the ſtory of the City of Refuge; the Man-ſlayer never fled thither, until the Avenger of blood purſued him. The City of Refuge is Jeſus Chriſt, and the Sinner never flies to Jeſus Chriſt to purpoſe, until the vengeance of a ſin-revengieg God, and the curſe of a condemning Law, and the horror of a ſelf-accuſing Conſcience, purſue the Soul like a chaſed Deer; now it flies to Jeſus Chriſt to purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Without humiliation the Sinner will never obey Chriſt; an unbroken Sinner is like an unbroken Colt that is not tamed, or like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken Heifer that will not ſubmit to the yoke: Jeſus Chriſt may command what he will, but he will do what he liſt. But when a Sinner comes to be humbled and unhors'd, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, then he ſays, <hi>Lord, What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Though it be never ſo croſs to my carnal and corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet I will do it. Before the Sinner is humbled, he is ever complaining of the unkindneſs of Gods dealing with him; but after he is humbled, he is ever complaining how unkindly he deals with God. <hi>As all diſobedience ſprings from pride, ſo all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſprings from humility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Without humiliation the Sinner will never conſtantly cleave to Jeſus Chriſt. There are many that ſeemingly cloſe with Chriſt for a while, juſt like thoſe that rejoyced in <hi>John Baptists</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for a while, <hi>John</hi> 5.35, <hi>He was a burning and a ſhining light, and ye were willing to rejoyce in
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:45614:186"/>his light for a ſeaſon.</hi> And you read of ſome that followed Chriſt for a while, <hi>but they were offended, and went back, and walked no more with him,</hi> John 6.66. There are many Profeſſors juſt like the Corn caſt into the ſecond ground in the Parable: <hi>It ſprang up for a while, but in time of temptation it withered;</hi> why? <hi>becauſe it wanted root:</hi> and why did it not root? becauſe the Plough of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion went not deep enough: ſo there are many Profeſſors that prove Apoſtates, and diſloyal to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but what is the reaſon? becauſe they were never throughly humbled; they are weary of Chriſts yoke, becauſe ehey never felt the burden of the Devils yoke, and of ſins yoke: that Soul that hath felt the burden of Satans yoke, will ſay, that Chriſts yoke is a ſweet and eaſie yoke; they that are truly humbled, will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Chriſt, but will cling and cleave to him, as a ſhip-wrack'd Mariner doth to a Rock: he will not part with it, becauſe he knows it is for his life.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This humiliation is neceſſary, becauſe without it we can never be conformable to Chriſt; for Chriſt was firſt humbled before he was exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>He drank of the brook in the way, before he lift up his head,</hi> Pſalm 110.7. Thus you have the Doctrine opened, now let us ſee what Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we can make of this Point; and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> are but two: the one of <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> and the other of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> I ſhall give you two <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> and two <hi>Exhortations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Inſtruction</hi> or <hi>Leſſon</hi> by way of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, is this: <hi>If ſound humiliation be ſuch a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Antecedent to Faith and Salvation,</hi> then it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the practice of thoſe Miniſters, that take this courſe in convincing, and humbling, and wounding,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:45614:187"/>and awakening ſleepy Sinners: you ſee what we Miniſters may do; nay, you ſee what we muſt do if with care and conſcience we would diſcharge our duty: we muſt ſometimes thunder and lighten, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did when he made <hi>Felix</hi> to tremble, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. We muſt ſtrike the Sinners heart with an Arrow of Conviction, as the Arrow that was ſhot at <hi>Ahab,</hi> entred in at the joints of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and pierc'd his heart, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.34. We muſt hedg in the Sinner with inevitable Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and meet him with a drawn Sword, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel did <hi>Balaam,</hi> Numb. 22.23. We muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times knock at the door of their hearts, and ſay to them, O thou unregenerate man, I have ſad news to tell thee! Thou canſt never, ſo long as thou art in this condition, ſee the face of God with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or enter into his Kingdom; thou mayſt ſee the face of God indeed, but it will be with frowns in his Forehead, and indignation in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to thee, when he ſhall ſentence thee to that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>blackneſs of darkneſs for ever,</hi> Jude 13. O Drunkard, I have ſad news to tell thee! Thou muſt drink of the Cup of Gods wrath and indignation, which will cauſe thee to ſpew and fall, and never riſe again. O Swearer, I have ſad news to tell thee! That the wrath of God is like a flying Rowl, hangs over the houſe of ever Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. O ignorant and diſobedient Sinner, I have ſad news to tell thee, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt will come in flames of fire to take vengeance on them that know him not, and obey not the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.7, 8. In a word, we muſt take any courſe to awaken Sinners out of their ſloath and ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Two ſorts of perſons there are that oppoſe this kind of Preaching: but moſt do not love it, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:45614:187"/>Firſt, the openly prophane and ſcandalous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that would fain ſleep in ſin, and go to Hell in a ſlumber: and therefore he looks upon ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening Sermons, as tormenting Sermons, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10, <hi>The two Prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the Earth.</hi> Oh this convincing, quickning and awakening Doctrine, this is but a torment to many carnal men: who cry out, <hi>What ado is there with theſe Miniſters? they will not let me be quiet, they torment me before my time.</hi> Ah poor wretch! Art thou afraid to be tormented before thy time? and art thou not afraid to be tormented time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end? There are ſome Beaſts ſo furious, that there is nothing but the fire will tame them: ſo there are ſome men ſo brutiſh that they are mad upon their evil ways: as it is ſaid of the <hi>Chaldeans, They are mad upon their Idols,</hi> Jer. 50.38. So, ſome are mad upon ſinful ways and courſes, that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt ſpit fire in their faces to rouſe them out of their ſecurity and ſpiritual Lethargy: Art thou angry with a Miniſter, who in tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to thy Soul, would pluck thy Soul as a firebrand out of the fire, and ſave it from eternal miſery and burnings? if one of you have a leg broken, you will ſend for a Chyrurgion to ſet it, and you will be contented that he ſhall put you to great pain for the recovering of your Limb, and reſtoring you to your former ſtate again; and will you not allow your Miniſters to put you to ſome pain, and grief, and trouble, for the recovering of your Souls from that wound and breach that ſin hath made upon you?</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſort that oppoſe convincing Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are <hi>Antinomians,</hi> that tell us there is no uſe of the Law under the Goſpel: and that Miniſters muſt
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:45614:188"/>preach nothing but Chriſt, and Grace, and Peace, and Comfort, and Mercy, and lead men to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a mild, and meek, and gentle way.</p>
            <p>To this I Reply: What, would you have us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Plaiſter where there is no ſore? Would you have us apply a Cordial where they are not ſick? Would you have us pour in the Oil, where there is no wound? God himſelf pours not in the Oil of Mercy, but into a broken Veſſel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. The Lord knows, we delight not in preaching any terrible Doctrines to you, if you were but fitted for mercy; but if you are not fitted for Mercy, then, as the pricking Needle makes way for the ſewing of the Cloth together: ſo this kind of Preaching, convincing, and humbling the Sinner, makes way for the bringing of Chriſt and the Soul together: and therefore you may well bear with it.</p>
            <p>A ſecond <hi>Inſtruction</hi> that we may learn from hence, is this: It ſerves to let us ſee what the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that there are ſo few Believers, ſo few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and convinced; O, Miniſters cannot ſpeak of this ſcarce without watery eyes. Truly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, three thouſand were converted at one Sermon: but now there is ſcarce one that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted with three thouſand Sermons. O whence is it that the work of Converſion is almoſt at an end in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>London?</hi> It is rare to hear of a Soul converted; we hear of many that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that are led into by-paths of Error, and Hereſie, and Blaſphemy, and Schiſm, but it is a rare matter to hear of one converted; they are but few that ſee the need they have of Chriſt; that prize him, that believe in him, that obey him, that conſtantly cleave to him: but moſt men are very
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:45614:188"/>well contented to be in a natural condition, they are ſecure and quiet without Chriſt; but what is the Reaſon? Becauſe they do not ſee the need they have of Chriſt; for if they did but ſee the need they have of him, they would ſay, They may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter want light, than want Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Light, and by whom they may have the <hi>Light of Life,</hi> John 8.12: They may better want Bread for their bodies, than the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the bread and ſpiritual food of the Soul: <hi>I am the Bread of Life,</hi> John 6. If they did but ſee the need they have of him, doubtleſs they would cloſe with him: but why do not they ſee the need that they have of him? The Reaſon is, Becauſe they are not humbled, they were never yet ſtricken with the ſenſe of ſin, they never yet ſaw the inſide of themſelves: they never with the Jaylor in the Text, were afrighted, amazed, ſtricken down in the ſenſe of ſin. Oh, this is the miſery of all miſeries, which Miniſters have moſt cauſe to complain of, that men are not fitted enough for Jeſus Chriſt; they are not loſt enough in themſelves for a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3, <hi>With thee the fatherleſs find mercy.</hi> Were we more hopeleſs, helpleſs and fatherleſs, we ſhould find more mercy from the hand of Jeſus Chriſt. O that God would awaken and ſhake ſome ſin-ſleeping Soul this day. Oh that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thus opened, might be as a Thunderbolt to let ſome of you ſee the inſide of your ſelves. O poor Sinner, thou haſt an inſupportable burden of ſin and guilt lying on thy Soul, ready to preſs thee down to Hell, and yet thou feeleſt it not; thou haſt the wrath of God hanging over thy head by the twined thred of a ſhort life, which it may be thou mayſt not be free from one year: nay, perhaps
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:45614:189"/>not one month, but thou ſeeſt it not; if thou didſt but ſee it, then thou wouldſt cry out as he did in <hi>Boſworth</hi> field, <hi>A Horſe, a Horſe, a Kingdom for a Horſe;</hi> ſo thou wouldſt cry out, None but Chriſt, nothing but Chriſt, ten thouſand Worlds for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Uſe of <hi>Exhortation;</hi> And I have but two <hi>Exhortations</hi> to tender to you:</p>
            <p>Firſt, I beſeech you, and exhort you in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, (whoſe poor Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger I am) that you would labour to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the neceſſity of humiliation; believe it, be perſwaded of it, be convinced of it, that thou muſt be broken, if ever thou wouldſt have Jeſus Chriſt to bind thee up; thou muſt be ſick of ſin, if ever thou wouldſt have Jeſus Chriſt to heal thee; thou muſt be dejected and caſt down, if ever thou wouldſt have Jeſus Chriſt to comfort thee; if God therefore do not open thine eyes, and awaken thy Conſcience, and touch thy heart, I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce againſt thee, that there is no Chriſt, no Heaven, no Pardon, no Peace, no Comfort, no Salvation for thee. Oh the miſerable, deplorable condition of all you that were never yet humbled, you that never yet were convinced of ſin, you that never taſted the bitterneſs of ſin, you that never felt the burden of ſin, that never yet complained with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Some derive the word from a man that is troubled with the ſtone in the bladder, <hi>O wretched man that I am!</hi> O miſerable is the condition that you are in: you that never yet felt ſin to be ſin, that have not felt the burden of it, nor taſted the bitterneſs of it, you are not fit to come to Jeſus Chriſt; you
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:45614:189"/>are out of his Commiſſion; for he is ſent to the humble and broken hearted Sinner, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. It may be thou knoweſt what ſin is, and Chriſt is, and Grace is, notionally; but there is a great deal of difference between knowing and inward feeling: wretched was thy condition if thou didſt but feel it; but a thouſand times more wretched it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou feeleſt it not.</p>
            <p>My ſecond <hi>Exhortation</hi> to you, is this: If ſo be <hi>ſound humiliation be a neceſſary Antecedent to Faith and Salvation;</hi> then uſe the utmoſt of your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that you may be humbled, broken, and bruiſed Sinners, that you may be put into a capacity to cloſe with a Saviour. Now becauſe I know this is but a harſh <hi>Exhortation;</hi> give me leave to ſweeten it with theſe three Conſiderations:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Remember that the promiſes of Grace and Mercy are made to all humbled Sinners, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41, <hi>If then their uncircumciſed hearts ſhall be humbled, and they accept of the puniſhment of their iniquities; then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob, and alſo my Covenant with Iſaac; and alſo my Covenant with Abraham will I remember, and I will remember the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider, God never looks with ſo much mercy and compaſſion on any, as thoſe that are moſt humbled, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 20, When <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoaned himſelf thus: <hi>Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke:</hi> I have been proud, and ſtout, and ſtubborn under all thy Rods: <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned. Surely after I was turned, I repented; after I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh, I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded.</hi> Now in the 20 <hi>verſe,</hi> you have God bemoaning <hi>Ephraim; Is Ephraim my
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:45614:190"/>dear Son? is he a pleaſant Child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Do but conſider, That this is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way that God leads men to mercy by; God uſually condemns before he juſtifies, he breaks before he binds up, he pulls down before he builds: <hi>There is a time to pull down, and a time to build up,</hi> Eccleſ. 3. That may be applyed to this purpoſe: This is, I ſay, Gods ordinary way; and would you have him to go out of his uſual courſe and way? If one of you ſhould ſay to your Neighbour, Let me come in at your window, or break down your wall, and then I will come in and viſit you: what anſwer (think you) would he make? If you do not come in at the door, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, do not come in to me.</p>
            <p>I, but ſome may ſay, <hi>What will you have us to do? Are we able to humble our ſelves? True in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when God hath firſt humbled us, then we are able to humble our ſelves; but you told us even now, In the firſt work of Converſion, we are meerly Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, we can do nothing towards our humiliation, it is the work of the Spirit of God; you have now preach'd Free-will to us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer: True indeed, in a ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we can do nothing that may pleaſe God, we cannot ſet one foot forwards in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but yet let me tell you, There is never an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Sinner but may do a great deal more than he doth, therefore I put you upon doing no more than you your ſelves can do, and that in theſe five Particulars: which I ſhall ſpeak a little to, and then have done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:45614:190"/>Firſt, Though you cannot humble your ſelves in a ſtate of unregeneracy, yet you may ſuffer another to do it for you, you may ſuffer it to be done. A man, for example, that is to be cut of the ſtone, though he cannot cut himſelf, he may ſuffer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to cut him; ſo a man that is ſick of this deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſtony diſeaſe, of the ſtone in the heart, though he cannot take it away himſelf, he may ſuffer it to be done; when the Word of God ploughs up the Fallow-ground of your hearts, you may hold up the Plough, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.22. You may ſuffer the Word of <hi>Exhortation</hi> which is tendered to you; when God wounds you by the Word, you may keep the wound open: Carnal men, when the Word hath wounded them, they lick them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whole by carnal counſels, and carnal compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and carnal reaſonings; O what a ſtir do men make to ſhake out the Arrow of Conviction, reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit of God that is ſtirring in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Word upon their hearts! how many are there that come in Armour to Church? they come in their Coat of Male! how many harden their necks, that the Word cannot pierce them! Now this you muſt not do: you muſt ſuffer the Word to rifle and ranſack your hearts: Let the Word ſmite you, as he ſaid, <hi>Pſal</hi> 141.5, <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me:</hi> Let the Word break my head, or heart, ſo it may but work upon my Soul. When God rouzeth you, ſuppoſe in any ſickneſs or cutting-croſs, you may join with God in rouzing your ſelves: when God ſmiteth you, may not you ſmite upon your thighs as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, and ſay, <hi>I am aſhamed; yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth?</hi> Jer. 31. In a word, when God humbles you, may not you humble your ſelves? therefore in
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:45614:191"/>tire fear of the Lord, reſolve to wait upon an awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſearching, Soul-piercing Miniſtry, and bleſs God for that Sermon that ſtabs ſin at the heart: bleſs God for that Miniſtry that ſpeaks moſt to thy Conſcience; you may ſuffer ſuch a thing to be done, though uſually ſuch a Miniſtry is look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a bug-Bear, who preacheth nothing but fire and wrath, and vengeance, and damnation. O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is that Word that wounds corruption, ſays the Soul. <hi>I have hewed them by my Prophets, and ſlain them by the words of my mouth,</hi> Hoſ. 6.5. God would have his Word a ſaving Word.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is never a one of you but can ponder and weigh things in your thoughts, that you can do; For example, If you have a good price proffered for ſuch a Commodity, or ſuch a bargain propounded to you, or ſuch a match for your Daughters, you can weigh it, and conſider it, you can conſider which is the beſt Commodity, and which is the beſt Match; ſo here, when the world comes and offers you preſent pay, if you will but part with the peace of a good Conſcience, and comply and ſwim with the ſtream, you ſhall never ſee the inſide of a Priſon: you may have this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and that Office, this Preferment, and that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment: but now ſays Jeſus Chriſt, Do but keep thy integrity, do but keep a good Conſcience, though thou ſuffer impriſonment, the loſs of all things, thou ſhalt never loſe by it; for, for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral loſs, thou ſhalt have everlaſting gain, the Kingdom of Heaven; now you can ponder and weigh things in your minds: you can conſider whether it is beſt to enjoy the World for a while, to be free from Priſons and troubles, ſo as to part with the peace of a good Conſcience, and loſe God
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:45614:191"/>for ever; or whether it is beſt to endure troubles, to enjoy God and the peace of a good Conſcience, and to enjoy an Eternity of Bleſſedneſs; it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to endure a thouſand Priſons, than to loſe the peace of a good Conſcience, and the favour of God; this, upon your conſidering and pondering, you will conclude: for the Devil he offers the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin that are but for a ſeaſon: but ſays Jeſus Chriſt, You ſhall have <hi>pleaſures at my right hand for evermore;</hi> no man in his wits but would ſay, it is better to have the pleaſures that are at Gods right hand for ever, than the pleaſures of ſin, which it may be I may not enjoy one year, not one month, not one day. So likewiſe, there is none of you but can conſider where you will lie when you are dead; O ſays one, I will lie in ſuch a Church, or in ſuch a Church yard; and cannot you conſider, O but where ſhall my Soul lie? ſhall the Angels carry it into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom? or ſhall the Devils carry it into darkneſs, that <hi>blackneſs of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ever?</hi> Jude 13. And you can meditate on the things that concern this life; every one can pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the things that concern his own temporal eſtate and concernment; and certainly, you may as well meditate upon the things that concern a future life: you may meditate on the joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and on the ſorrows and torments of Hell, and the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt. There is a ſtory of a man that read in a Book every day that had three Leaves: a white leaf, a red leaf, a black leaf; the white leaf of the Book, that was the joys of Heaven; the red leaf, that was the blood of Jeſus Chriſt; the black leaf, that was the torments of Hell. You may look into Hell by contemplation and meditation, that you may prevent Hell to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:45614:192"/>you may meditate upon the blood of Chriſt, and ſteep as it were your ſouls in it by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may be it may ſoften them. It is ſaid of the Goats blood, when nothing can ſoften an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant, the blood of Goats can; the blood of Chriſt, that can ſoften your hard hearts, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A third thing you can do, you can ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row more, and mourn more than you do; there is none of you but can ſorrow and mourn for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward loſſes: loſs of Friends, as Husband and Wife, or Child, perhaps for the loſs of a Horſe; what canſt thou mourn for the loſs of a Child, and canſt thou not mourn for the loſs of a Soul, when one Soul is worth all the Kingdoms in the World? If any of you have loſt a good Bargain, or miſt a good Market, you can grieve for this; O methinks you ſhould mourn for this, how many Market days have I loſt for my Soul? I have burnt out many a precious light, and ſpent out my precious time; and can you not mourn for the loſs of ſuch a Bargain as this is? Suppoſe one of you ſhould be ſent for before a mighty Monarch, and ſhould be impeach'd of high Treaſon before him; how would you tremble to appear before ſo mighty a King, that hath power in his hands to cut you off inſtantly! O you and I muſt appear before the great Judg of Heaven and Earth, the King of Kings, that knows all the ſins and Treaſons that ever we have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and you ſhould bleſs God if you are caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fear, and thereby be brought to mourn, and grieve, and ſorrow for your ſins, <hi>Job</hi> 23.16, <hi>For God maketh my heart ſoft, and the Almighty trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth me;</hi> that is, ſoft by troubling of me.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is never a one of you but may
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:45614:192"/>leave groſs and ſcandalous ſins, which I prove thus: you can do it for fear of men, and you may do it much more for fear of God. A prophane Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if he be in the company of a Godly grave Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. he can refrain his mouth from vile talk: he can forbear his Oaths, and blaſphemous Speeches, and obſcene expreſſions. An Adulterer, if a boy be but in the Room of ſeven years old, he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to act his uncleanneſs, until the boy be out of the Room. If you can forbear groſs ſins for fear of men, much more can you do it for fear of God. If a boy can ſay his Leſſon with a Rod, certainly he can do it without a Rod: if you can abſtain from groſs ſins for fear, certainly you can do it without. You read of the hypocritical <hi>Phariſee,</hi> he abſtained from groſs ſins, <hi>Luke</hi> 18, <hi>God, I thank thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am not as other men are, Extortioners, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, Adulterers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Though it is true, a man in a ſtate of Nature, is dead in treſpaſſes and ſin: yet then, at that time he may do many good works, works mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good, works materially good: he may faſt, and pray, and give Alms; therefore it is that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Break off thy ſins by righteouſneſs, and thine iniquities by ſhewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the poor,</hi> Dan. 4.27. Certainly the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> would never have ſpoken ſo to him, if it had not been in his power to do it. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> though they wanted the knowledg of the Law, and had not the Law, (ſaith he) <hi>Yet they did by Nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law, they were a Law to themſelves, which ſhews that the works of the Law are written in their hearts,</hi> Rom. 2.13, 14. They that are in an unregenerate eſtate, they may pray, they may
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:45614:193"/>make Conſcience of praying in their Families; though they cannot pray as they ſhould, yet they may pray as they are able: they may fall down at the feet of God, and ſay, Lord, I am a poor ſinful wretch, I cannot pleaſe thee, praying, or not pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; thou haſt promiſed to give the ſpirit of prayer to them that ask it, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13, <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Say, Lord give me thy Spirit to break my hard heart: take any way with me, ſo my proud heart may be humbled, and hard heart broken, that I may welcom Jeſus Chriſt to my Soul, that I may believe in him, and caſt my Soul upon him. So that Beloved, I put you upon no more than you are able to do: you may ſuffer the word of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> you can ponder and weigh the Word in your own hearts, you may ſorrow and mourn for ſin: you may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from groſs ſins, and you may do thoſe works that are morally good: do what you can do; men are not damned becauſe they can do no better, but becauſe they will do no better, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23, <hi>O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Jeruſalem, I would have gathered thee as a Hen her Chickens under her wings, but ye would not. If there were no will, there would be no Hell,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Do what you can, ſet upon works of Holineſs and Piety: ſtrive and put forth your ſtrength to the uttermoſt endeavour of your Souls, to get your hearts humbled, to ſee ſin, and to ſigh for it, to grieve and groan for it; lay your conditions to heart, be feelingly apprehenſive of that wrath that ſin hath kindled, of that Juſtice that ſin hath provoked, of that Mercy that ſin hath abuſed, of that vengeance and anger that ſin hath
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:45614:193"/>deſerved to be inflicted. O were we but thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, we ſhould have cauſe to bleſs God to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. I ſhall cloſe with one word to thoſe that have been under a ſpirit of bondage, that have been convinced, awakened as this Jaylor was, that have had their broken bones, that have felt the burden of ſin, and it may be lie under that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at this day: O be you comforted, its better to be broken here, than hereafter; it is better to be convinced here than convinced hereafter; it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be humbled here, than for God to humble the Soul in Hell to all Eternity; God will make thy Valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> a Door of Hope, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.15. Thou that art humbled now, ſhalt be exalted: and thou that mourneſt now, ſhalt be comforted.</p>

            <p>THis Chapter contains in it that admirable and Heavenly Sermon of our Saviour, concerning the <hi>Bread of Life;</hi> wherein you may take notice of three parts:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, The occaſion of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that was the Peoples following of him, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did eat of the Loaves, and were filled,</hi> Verſe 26.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, The Sermon it ſelf: and that is from <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, to <hi>ver.</hi> 59.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, You have the iſſue or conſequence of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:45614:194"/>the Sermon: ſome believed, and ſome revolted: ſome murmured, and ſome marvelled.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Text that I have now read unto you, is part of the Sermon it ſelf, wherein our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, becauſe of the ſtupidity and incredulity of his Auditors, doth again and again, both preſs and prove this Heavenly Doctrine, that he himſelf was <hi>the Bread of Life; I am</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Bread of Life: he that cometh to me ſhall not hunger, and he that believeth on me, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> In which Text, you may take notice of theſe two parts:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, An undeniable Propoſition, <hi>I am the Bread of Life.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, A comfortable Inference upon that Propoſition, <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall nevtr thirſt.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt, the evident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Propoſition, <hi>I am the Bread of Life:</hi> which words muſt not be underſtood literally, as if our Saviour was ſuch Corporal Bread as could be chewed in the mouth, and digeſted in the ſtomach, as the <hi>Capernaites</hi> did fondly conceive, when they ſaid, <hi>How can this man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> this was as groſs a conceit, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s, who askt, <hi>If he ſhould go into his Mothers womb again, and be born.</hi> But the words muſt be underſtood in a Metaphorical ſenſe; That as Bread ſtrengthens the body, and revives the ſpirit, and ſupports the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a man, and enables him to perform natural actions with more vigour and vivacity; ſo likewiſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſtrengthens the Soul, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives the ſpirit, and ſupports us in our ſpiritual life, and helps us to perform ſpiritual duties in a ſpiritual manner: therefore he ſaith, <hi>I am the Bread of Life.</hi> He is not only bread, but the bread of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:45614:195"/>life, becauſe it is he that gives us ſpiritual life here, and preſerves that life, and will hereafter give to us Eternal liſe in Glory; and therefore he is called <hi>The Bread of Life.</hi> So then the Doctrine I would commend to you from hence, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is that living bread, that gives Spiritual and Eternal life to all thoſe that have a part and intereſt in him.</p>
            <p>This is a Truth ſo unqueſtionable, that it is no leſs than ſix times repeated in this one Chapter: And for the better Confirmation of it, it may be demanded:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, <hi>Wherein doth our Saviour reſemble bread?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, <hi>And how doth it appear that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is better than bread?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak briefly to them both:</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Wherein doth our Saviour reſemble bread?</hi> I will name but three particulars, though I know more might be reckoned up.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Bread you know it is prepared food: the Corn muſt be threſhed, and winnowed, and ground in a Mill, and baked in an Oven, before it can be bread for us to eat. So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he was threſhed, as I may ſay, by afflictions and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, <hi>He was a man of ſorrows:</hi> and he was winnowed by temptations: he was baked, and ſcorch'd, as it were, in the Oven of his Fathers wrath: for, it was <hi>he that trod the Winepreſs of his Fathers wrath alone</hi> for us; and all this was done before he could be made fit Bread, that is a fit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for our Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:45614:195"/>Secondly, Bread you hnow it is common food, it is common to the poor, as well as to the rich; for the fooliſh, as well as the wiſe; the poor have bread if they have any thing; ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he is a common Saviour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for all ranks and conditions of men; for high and low, and rich and poor, noble and ignoble; all are beholding to Jeſus Chriſt here: <hi>There is neither Greek, nor Jew, Circumciſion, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, Barbarian, Scythian, Bond nor Free, but Chriſt is all and in all,</hi> Col. 3.11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Bread you know it is the principal food, it is the ſtay and ſupport of a mans life, therefore it is called <hi>The ſtaff of bread,</hi> Iſa. 3.1. So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he is the principal por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Souls of all Believers: <hi>He is the choiceſt of ten thouſand,</hi> Cant. 5.10. We may better want any thing than bread: The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is as I may ſay, not only the food of our Souls, but the Soul of our Souls, and the Life of our Lives.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It may be demanded: <hi>But wherein doth Jeſus Chriſt excel this corporal bread?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in theſe four reſpects:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Corporal bread, though it doth help to preſerve life, yet it cannot give life; but now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is he that gives ſpiritual Life; he begins it, and begets it in his People, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, <hi>You hath he quickned who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> And hence it is that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is called the ſecond <hi>Adam: The firſt man Adam was made a living Soul, the laſt Adam was made a quickning Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.45. And in <hi>John</hi> 5.21, <hi>For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickneth them, even ſo the Son quickneth whom be will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:45614:196"/>Secondly, Bread doth ſatisfie but one appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, namely, hunger; never was it known that bread could ſatisfie thirſt: but now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he can ſatisfie all the deſires of the Soul, and ſupply all the wants of the Soul, he is both the bread of life, and the water of life: nay, not only bread and water, but he is cloathing to the Soul; as it is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ult. Put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> So that he is both Food and Spiritual Cloathing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Bread, though it ſatisfie your hunger for the preſent, yet it cannot ſo take away your hunger that you ſhall hunger no more; if it ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie hunger to day, you will be hungry again to morrow. But now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth ſo ſatisfie the hunger of our Souls, that we ſhall never hunger nor thirſt more: for ſo the Text tells you, <hi>He that comes to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Corporal bread you know is periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and doth but nouriſh a periſhing life, <hi>John</hi> 6.27, <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth.</hi> But now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is not periſhing bread, but that bread that endures for ever; and that life that he gives, is not a periſhing life neither, <hi>John</hi> 6.51, <hi>I am the living bread which came down from Heaven; if any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live for ever; and the bread which I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> So you ſee the Point opened. Let me briefly apply it, becauſe I principally aim at the ſecond part of the Text, the comfortable-Inference. But for the improvement of this Point:</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of <hi>Information;</hi> and then by way of <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:45614:196"/>Firſt, By way of <hi>Information:</hi> there are three Doctrinal Inferences from the Point thus opened, that may be thence deduced:</p>
            <p>Firſt, If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be that living bread that gives Spiritual and Eternal life to them that believe in him, then you may learn this Leſſon, That ſuch, and ſo great is the indiſpenſable need that we have of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that without him we are undone for ever. In the 53d <hi>verſe</hi> of this exeellent Chapter: <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, except you eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</hi> He ſpeaks there of eating of his fleſh, and drinking his blood, in a ſpiritual manner. You know there are many deſires of the Soul that may be diſpenced with, but hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is a deſire that muſt be ſatisfied; unleſs you have bread for your ſuſtenance, the body dies: ſo unleſs you have Jeſus Chriſt for your ſpiritual ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance, your Souls die, and drop down into Hell for ever: for, look as the union of the Body with the Soul, is the life of the Body; ſo the union of the Soul with Jeſus Chriſt, is the life of the Soul. O hearken to this, thou that art yet in a natural and unregenerate eſtate, uncalled, unconverted, that never was yet tranſplanted from off the old rotten ſtock of <hi>Adam,</hi> and replanted into the true Vine, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; if thou liveſt in this eſtate, and dieſt in this eſtate, thou art undone for ever; the pooreſt worm that crawls upon the ground, is in a better condition than thou art in, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.27, <hi>Believeſt thou the Prophets?</hi> (ſaid St. <hi>Paul</hi> to King <hi>Agrippa</hi>) <hi>I know that thou belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</hi> Believeſt thou this Doctrine? ſay I to thee, that art yet uncalled, unconverted, I know thou believeſt it not: for, if thou didſt believe it, thou
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:45614:197"/>couldeſt not reſt contented in a Chriſtleſs condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for one week, no, not for one day: but wouldeſt by prayers and tears, and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cry out, <hi>Lord Jeſus give me thy ſelf, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou denyeſt me: give me thy ſelf, though I be as poor as Job upon the Dunghil.</hi> But we cannot perſwade men that the danger of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural eſtate and condition is ſo great as indeed it is; but the Lord convince you and perſwade you of it.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Doctrinal Inference that may be hence deduced, is this: <hi>If Jeſus Chriſt be the living bread,</hi> then it follows, the vanity and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, and inſufficiency of all Creature-accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations is exceeding great: name what you will of theſe outward accommodations that the World do ſo greedily gape after: whether Riches, or Honours, or Pleaſures, or goodly brave Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, this and that: alas, we may ſay of them, they are not bread, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2, <hi>Wherefore do you ſpend your money for that which is not bread?</hi> Your money, that is, your precious opportunities: your time, that is your money to make your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets for Eternity with, for Moments are the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets for Eternity; <hi>Wherefore do you ſpend your money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> Alas, alas, theſe outward things they are neither ſatisfactory, nor perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: they are not ſatisfactory: for <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>He that loveth ſilver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver, nor he that loveth abundance, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.10. As ſoom may you hope to fill a Cheſt with Wiſdom and Knowledg, as to fill a Soul, which is a ſpiritual ſubſtance, with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things. And as theſe outward things are
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:45614:197"/>are ſatisfactory, ſo neither are they permanent or laſting, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13, <hi>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God ſhall deſlroy both it and them.</hi> Look as the belly devours the meat, ſo the worms at laſt ſhall devour the belly, and ſo both meat and belly periſh together. But if you can but once get this ſpiritual bread, the Lord Chriſt, you ſhall never periſh. Alas, alas, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your own folly and brutiſhneſs, in ſeeking for ſatisfaction here below, where none is to be found: your bread without Chriſt, is but gravel in your throats; your moral Vertues without Chriſt, are but glittering ſins: your bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, are but duſt and aſhes: duſt that will drop down into the Grave, and aſhes that are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Furnace of Hell-fire; your Souls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, are but the Devils Palace: your lives without Chriſt, is but the ſervice of ſin; and your deaths without Chriſt, will be nothing elſe but the wages of ſin. Oh, who would reſt then in a Chriſtleſs condition! Who would ſit down contented with theſe poor, tranſitory, ſhadowy comforts!</p>
            <p>A third Leſſon we may learn by way of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, is this: <hi>If Jeſus Chriſt be the living bread,</hi> then our main end and errand in coming to the Lords Table, is not to feed the Body, but to feed the Soul, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.21, <hi>What, have you not Houſes to eat and to drink in?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. So that it is not the end of your coming to the Lords Table, therefore you eat but a little piece of Bread, and drink but a little draught of Wine, to put you in mind that it is not the Body that you come to feed, but you come to feed the Soul; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhould labour to get a preparation ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:45614:198"/>to that ſpiritual bread that you are to taſte of; <hi>But what is that?</hi> you will ſay. I anſwer, There ſhould be ſomething done before your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſomething done in the Adminiſtration of the Elements, and ſomething done after the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Elements.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There ſhould be ſomething done before you come: Oh beg a bleſſing upon your ſpiritual bread; <hi>Man lives not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> Matth. 4.4. I may apply it thus: Your Souls will not live by this Sacramental Bread, but by the Word of Gods bleſſing; If God will bleſs this ſpiritual food to you, your Souls ſhall live. On therefore beg the Bleſſing of God upon this Heavenly Bread.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And then there is ſomething to be done while you are eating this Bread; you ſhould get your hearts all on fire with love to this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Redeemer that was contented to be made bread, to be prepared food, as I told you even now: to be threſhed, and winnowed, and ground, and bak'd, and ſcorch'd in the Oven of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wrath; Oh, how ſhould your hearts be all on a flame with Love, as the two Diſciples were, going to <hi>Emaus; As Jeſus Chriſt brake bread, and gave it to them, and opened to them the Scriptures, their hearts did burn within them,</hi> (Luke 24.32.) they were as it were all on a fire. So ſhould it be with you when you come to the Lords Table: you ſhould have your meditations wholly taken up with that which is the life of the Sacrament, even the death of our Saviour; let not your hearts be roving, and wandering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, watch them narrowly: you will hardly keep
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:45614:198"/>them cloſe to a duty two Minutes without great watching.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is ſomething to be done after, when you have eaten of this living bread: that is, to be exceeding thankful: ſtudy <hi>to walk worthy of the Lord unto all well-pleaſing.</hi> That's the firſt Uſe, of <hi>Information.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is of <hi>Exhortation. Is Jeſus Chriſt that living bread that gives eternal life to all thoſe that have a part and intereſt in him?</hi> Then let my counſel be accepted with you: give no reſt to your Eyes, no ſatisfaction to your Souls in any condition, with any portion or priviledg whatſoever, until you have gotten this bread, until you have gotten Jeſus Chriſt to be your portion, to be the food of your Souls. That which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of Wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.7, <hi>Wiſdom is the principal thing, therefore get Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and with all thy gettings, get underſtanding.</hi> So ſay I, this is the principal Bread: therefore get Chriſt, and above all thy gettings, get Chriſt. I, but may be you will ſay, <hi>How ſhall we get him?</hi> I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, You muſt highly prize him, eſteeming all things but droſs in compariſon of him: you muſt eſteem all outward things but as Dogs meat in compariſon of that bread which is in your Fathers Houſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You muſt earneſtly beg him; you muſt pray as the <hi>Capernaites</hi> did, <hi>Lord, evermore give us this bread,</hi> ver. 34, of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You muſt labour for him; <hi>Labour not for that meat that periſheth, but for that bread hat endures to eternal life,</hi> John 6.27. <hi>But how muſt we labour for him?</hi> You muſt labour for him in
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:45614:199"/>the uſe of his Ordinances: as Praying, Reading, Hearing, Communicating at the Lords Table, and the like.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When you have found him, or know where this bread is to be had, you muſt hunger and thirſt for him; for the Lord Chriſt will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow himſelf upon that Soul that doth not breathe and break with longing deſires for him.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, You muſt be ſure by Faith to apply him to your own Souls. Bread, when it ſtands upon the Table, is common bread; but when I have eaten it, then it is my bread: then it turns to my nouriſhment, to my ſubſtance; ſo you muſt make Application of Chriſt to your Souls.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you would have Chriſt, you muſt learn to live upon him: As a man lives upon bread, ſo you muſt live upon Chriſt; live upon him in point of Juſtification, in point of Sanctification and Salvation: <hi>As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father, ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me,</hi> ver. 57, of this Chapter. If you live in him, and live upon him, you ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after for ever live with him. And ſo much of the firſt Branch of the Text, the evident Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>I come now to the comfortable Inference that is thence deduced: <hi>He that cometh to me ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hunger, and he that believeth in me, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> By coming to Chriſt, is meant believing in Chriſt; for the latter Phraſe doth expound the former: <hi>He that cometh to me;</hi> that is, he that believes in me. Coming, you know, is a motion, and in a motion there are two terms: there is the <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> and <hi>terminus ad quem:</hi> ſomething a man comes from, and ſomething a man comes to;
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:45614:199"/>ſo believing is a motion of the Soul: a man comes from himſelf, from his own righteouſneſs, from his own ends: he comes from the World, and then he comes to Chriſt; he comes to him, as one that is able to give him fit and full ſatisfaction to his Soul; <hi>He that comes to me ſhall never hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and he that believes in me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks here of a ſpiritual hunger, and of a ſpiritual thirſt; the meaning is this, <hi>He that believes in me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, he ſhall have all his wants ſupplied, all his deſires allayed, and he ſhall have his Soul fully ſatisfied. So then the Doctrine I ſhall give you from this ſecond Branch of the Text, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Whoſoever believes in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall by Chriſt have all his ſpiritual wants ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and all his deſires allayed, and his ſoul fully ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Why is Jeſus Chriſt not only compared to Bread, but alſo to Water, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteh, come to the waters of life.</hi> By <hi>water,</hi> is meant Jeſus Chriſt. Why is he compared not to <hi>Water,</hi> but to <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Milk: Come, buy Wine and Milk, without Money, and without Price;</hi> but only to ſhew that he is able to give the Soul fit and full ſatisfaction? Here are two Queries I ſhall ſpeak to by way of Explication.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, <hi>How, or in what ſenſe this Doctrine is true, He that believes in Christ, ſhall have all his deſires ſatisfied.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>How it comes to paſs, or what is the reaſon, that ſuch a ſoul as believes in Chriſt ſhall have the ſpiritual deſires of his ſoul ſatisfied?</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:45614:200"/>Firſt, <hi>How, or in what ſenſe this Doctrine holds true, That he that believes in Chriſt, ſhall by Chriſt have all his deſires anſwered?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, You muſt know the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the Soul are of three ſorts: there are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſires, and ſenſual deſires, and ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There are ſinful deſires of the Soul: there is no man but naturally he doth as eagerly deſire to ſin, as he deſires to eat when he is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.17, <hi>They eat the bread of wickedneſs, and drink the Wine of violence.</hi> Naturally a man hath a Dog-like thirſt after ſin: ſome after one luſt, ſome after another: <hi>Do you think the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith in vain, the ſpirit that is in us luſteth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy?</hi> James 4.5. That which is here ſpoken of Envy, may be ſpoken of any other ſin. Some luſt after covetouſneſs, ſome luſt after pride, ſome after envy: ſome after one thing, ſome after another. But mark now, as ſoon as the Soul comes to Jeſus Chriſt, and believes in him, theſe deſires and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts ſhall be quenched, becauſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will make ſuch a Soul to be dead to ſin: A dead man deſireth nothing. I know, my Brethren, that this is to be underſtood in part, becauſe our mortification is imperfect, therefore all the ſinful deſires of the Soul will not be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this life. But thus far it holds true, <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not,</hi> 1 John 3.9: that is, ſo far forth as a man is born of God, he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not; there is a nature in him that ſinneth not, a Divine Nature, for he is made partaker of the Divine Nature; there is ſomething in him that doth not ſin, that doth not luſt after ſin, but luſteth againſt ſin: he hath ſomething
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:45614:200"/>in him that doth not ſin; <hi>As the fleſh luſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit, ſo the Spirit luſteth againſt the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.17. Theſe ſenſual deſires ſhall be quenched.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are ſenſual deſires, that is, a luſting after the lawful contentments of this life. Some luſt after one diſh of the World, and ſome after another. <hi>Zacheus,</hi> a pining Publican, he luſted after the gain of the World: I, but when he comes to Chriſt, this luſtful deſire of his is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed; for, ſaid he, <hi>Lord, now half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have done wrong, I will make recompence fourfold.</hi> Here is an admirable example for ſome to follow, that make haſte to be rich, as <hi>Solomon</hi> hath it: <hi>He that makes haſte to be rich ſhall not be innocent,</hi> Prov. 28.20. Such a one had need to think of reſtitution. So the Diſciples in the Primitive time: they <hi>ſold their poſſeſſions, and brought them and laid them down at the Apoſtles feet,</hi> Acts 4.35. Why at the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles feet? becauſe they regarded their outward poſſeſſions (in compariſon of Heavenly treaſure, which they were made partakers of) no more than the dirt under their feet. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at the firſt was taken with the World, it was as a fine Noſegay to him; but afterwards, when he was crucified to the World, and the World to him, he look'd upon it but as a withered Flower.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There are ſome ſpiritual deſires of the Soul, and theſe ſhall be ſatisfied; thoſe thirſts after Grace ſhall be ſatisfied; ſo that a man that once believes in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall no more thirſt for Grace; no more thirſt for Grace, may ſome ſay? why none thirſt ſo much for Grace, as they that have Grace. It is true, and yet I ſhall make
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:45614:201"/>my words good, he ſhall not thirſt for Grace in two ſenſes or reſpects:</p>
            <p>Firſt, He ſhall not have a total and painful thirſt after Grace; There is a twofold thirſting, as Divines well obſerve, after Grace:— There is a thirſt ariſing from a total want of Grace; this is a painful and deadly thirſt, now this thirſt for Grace ſhall be quite quenched. — And then there is a thirſt ariſing from a ſenſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of the grace we have; and this thirſt, it is true, ſhall never be fully ſatisfied until we come to Heaven: but the painful thirſt that ſhall be taken away; ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 4.14, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall drink of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt, but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a Well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> Such a one ſhall never have a painful thirſt more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A man that believes in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall not have a hopeleſs, and helpleſs thirſt; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he may be thirſting after Grace ſtill, yet it is not a hopeleſs thirſt, becauſe he hath a Spring and Storehouſe to go to for ſatisfaction: <hi>What is that Spring and Storehouſe?</hi> I anſwer, There is a double Spring or Storehouſe:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, he is the Fountain of living water, and he is that Spring that refreſheth the Soul; <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19</item>
                  <item>Secondly, The precious Promiſes, they are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spring for the Souls ſatisfaction. Oh, what refreſhing doth often flow into the Soul from thoſe rich and precious Promiſes!</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be you will ſay to me, <hi>When ſhall a Believer thus have all his deſires ſatisfied, his ſinful
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:45614:201"/>deſires quenched, his ſenſual deſires allayed, and his ſpiritual deſires after grace ſatisfied?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, partly in this life, and partly in the life to come: — Partly in this life, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſhall be ſatisfied, he ſhall have a fulneſs ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his condition, while he lives upon the Earth: as a Child hath ſtrength ſuitable to a Child; ſo a Believer ſhall have a fulneſs ſuitable to his condition. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Pſalm 63.5. This was a ſuitable fulneſs. — But then in the life to come, there ſhall be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat ſatisfaction given in to the Soul; then ſhall this Scripture be fulfilled, <hi>In thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there is fulneſs of Joy, and at thy right hand are Pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſalm 16.11. And ſaith he in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17.15, <hi>As for me, I will behold thy face in righteouſneſs; I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi> In that one Verſe you have a picture of Heaven, which conſiſts in Viſion of God, <hi>I will behold thy face in righteouſneſs:</hi> in Conformity to God, <hi>When I awake with thy likeneſs:</hi> in Satisfaction in God, <hi>I ſhall be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> Viſion of God, Conformity to God, and Satisfaction in God, this makes up Heaven. And that is a moſt precious Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.23, <hi>Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi> It is as if our Saviour ſhould ſay, This Joy cannot enter into thee becauſe of thy ſtraitneſs, but thou maiſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it becauſe of its largeneſs. The Sea can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into a Hogſhead, becauſe it is a Veſſel that cannot contain it: but the Hogſhead may enter into the Sea, becauſe the Sea can fill it. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very gaping deſire of the Soul ſhall then be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with as much Grace, and Glory, and Holineſs,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:45614:202"/>and Happineſs, as it can be capable of receiving; every Veſſel ſhall then be filled according to its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. A Pint, it is true, doth not contain ſo much as a Pottle, but the Pint ſhall be filled, filled as well as the Pottle.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>But how comes this to paſs, that a Believer ſhall have all his deſires ſatisfied?</hi> I ſhall give you but two Reaſons for it:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe Faith makes Jeſus Chriſt a mans own; it is the eſpouſing Grace, it is the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ring that makes up the Match between Chriſt and the Soul. If <hi>Thomas</hi> do but put his finger into his Saviours ſide, Oh, ſaith he, <hi>My Lord, and my God;</hi> now he ſaith, Lord Jeſus thou art mine. The woman as ſoon as ſhe is married to her Husband, is partaker of an intereſt in all his Goods: <hi>With all my worldly Goods I thee endow.</hi> Thus the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as ſoon as by Faith he is made ours, all his is made ours: <hi>He is made of God to us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Faith as it makes Jeſus Chriſt ours, ſo by making him ours, it makes God the Father to be ours alſo: Faith makes God our Father to be our Husband, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5, <hi>For thy Maker is thine Husband;</hi> It makes God our Father to be our Friend, our Portion, our Shield, our Rock, our Refuge, our Redeemer, our All. Now when Faith hath made Chriſt to be ours, and by Chriſt hath made God to be ours, then we may ſay, All is ours. A man that hath the Sea, cannot want water; he that hath the Sun, cannot want light; he that hath a Golden Mine, cannot want trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: So he that hath gotten Jeſus Chriſt to be his Portion, he hath all that his heart can
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:45614:202"/>deſire: he ſhall have all his Soul-wants ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Now briefly to make Application, and there are but two Uſes I ſhall ſpeak unto:</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Conſolation, becauſe that is the proper Uſe of this Doctrine, and therefore I put it in the firſt place. Art thou one that art a true Believer? Haſt thou caſt thy Soul into the arms of Jeſus Chriſt? Haſt thou received Jeſus Chriſt? that is, Haſt thou believed in him? Haſt thou received him in all his Offices, as King, as Prieſt, as Prophet? Art thou as willing to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him, as to be redeemed by him? Haſt thou got Jeſus Chriſt, not only by outward profeſſion, (ſo all of you have that hear me this day) but haſt thou got Chriſt by inward poſſeſſion, ſo that Chriſt is thine? Oh, lift up thy head with joy! O know aſſuredly, that all thy ſinful deſires ſhall by little and little be quenched; though God do leave ſome corruptions in thee, to conflict with, and to teach thee to prize the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt at a high rate, yet all theſe ſinful deſires ſhall by little and little be mortified: and all thy ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires fully ſatisfied, though not perfectly in this World, yet when thou comeſt to enjoy him in Glory; but yet here in this life, thou ſhalt have ſo much ſatisfaction, that thou mayſt ſay with the Prophet <hi>David, My Soul is ſatisfied as with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Fatneſs.</hi> And all thy ſenſual deſires ſhall be allayed, though it may be thou haſt but a poor pittance of theſe outward things: for God ſees it fit many times that his beſt and ſoundeſt Sheep ſhould be kept on the ſhorteſt Commons: although this be true, that thou haſt but a ſmall pittance of theſe outward things: thou wanteſt riches and honours, and outward accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:45614:203"/>which are ſo much admired; yet thou mayſt ſay with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10, <hi>As having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet poſſeſſing all things:</hi> Though I have nothing, yet I poſſeſs all things: How? Really I poſſeſs all things, I have all things in <hi>Capite,</hi> in Chriſt my Head, and really by Faith: Oh what comfort is this!</p>
            <p>Secondly, I might in the ſecond place make this a Touch-ſtone of tryal to diſcover to you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be true Believers, or no. Are thy deſires after the World allayed, that now thou canſt ſay with St. <hi>Paul, I have learned in every ſtate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be content?</hi> Haſt thou not a painful thirſt ariſing from the guilt of a ſelf-accuſing Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as thou hadſt heretofore? then it is a token that thy Faith is a true Faith; and by this thou mayſt know whether thou art a weak Believer, or a ſtrong Believer; for according to the meaſure of your ſatisfaction in theſe things, ſo you may know the meaſure of your Faith. If thy Soul hath large ſatisfaction, then thou art a ſtrong Believer; but if thy Soul hath but little ſatisfaction, then thou art but a weak Believer.</p>
            <p>But to cloſe all with a word of Exhortation, and the Exhortation is to two ſorts briefly:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, To thoſe that are not Believers.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, To thoſe that are true Believers.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, To thoſe that are not Believers, and my Exhortation to them, is this: O you that have not yet cloſed with Jeſus Chriſt; you that have not yet ſeen ſo much beauty in him as to prize him, and inſatiably to deſire him, O that now you would begin to cloſe with him: you that have not been perſwaded by all former Exhortations and Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Miniſters heretofore; be perſwaded now,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:45614:203"/>O come, come to Jeſus Chriſt, come to the water of life: <hi>Come buy Wine and Milk, without money, and without price,</hi> come to this bread of life; thou mayſt come as freely to Jeſus Chriſt, O Sinner, whoever thou art, as the wounded <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might come to the Brazen Serpent in the Wilderneſs: O conſider what ſatisfaction is to be found in him! Run through all the courſes of the World, run through all conditions in the World, run through all the delights of the ſons of men, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can give you ſatisfaction, yea or no. Can ſin give you ſatisfaction? Truly, the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which ſin gives, I will tell you what it is like: it is juſt like the ſprinkling of water upon the Smiths Forge, that makes the fire to burn ſo much the hotter: or like the pouring of Oyl upon a flame, that makes it flame ſo much the fiercer; this is the ſatisfaction that you have by ſin. Or, can the World give you ſatisfaction: Alas, the World deals with you juſt as <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s Mule did with him, leaving his Maſter hanging in the Oak, when he had moſt need of her; ſo when you have moſt need of comfort and relief, Worldly riches and profits they leave you. In a day of wrath can any of theſe give you ſatisfaction? <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.4, <hi>They profit not in a day of wrath.</hi> Can any of theſe outward things give you ſatisfaction? alas, the Soul of man hath a kind of infiniteneſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in it, therefore nothing can give the Soul ſatisfaction, but the infinite mercy of a Gracious God, and the infinite merits of a bleſſed Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the infinite Comforts of the Holy Ghoſt. As long as you live without Chriſt, never look for ſatisfaction, look for no ſatisfaction from the things of this life, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.13, <hi>Therefore thus ſaith
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:45614:204"/>the Lord God, behold, my Servants ſhall eat, but ye ſhall be hungry: my Servants ſhall drink, but ye ſhall be thirſty; behold, my Servants ſhall rejoyce, but ye ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> Look for no ſatisfaction from temporal things, and I am ſure in Hell there will be no ſatisfaction for you; for there you will be always thirſting, thirſting with a painful and tormenting thirſt. <hi>Dives,</hi> although he had never ſo much wealth to tumble himſelf up and down in here while he lived, yet when he came to Hell (though perhaps he might by ſome flattering Preacher in a Funeral Sermon be lodged in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> boſom, yet when he came to Hell) he had not a drop of water to cool his tongue. There is no ſatisfaction to be had in any Enjoyment. nor in any condition, or place, until we come to Jeſus Chriſt, and then we ſhall hunger no more, nor thirſt no more: then all tears ſhall be wiped from our eyes, and ſorrow and grief from our hearts.</p>
            <p>My ſecond Exhortation is to true Believers: Oh labour for further degrees of Faith; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your meaſure of Faith, ſuch will your ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſatisfaction be, (<hi>Pſalm</hi> 81.10) O, could you open your mouths wide: that is, could the deſires of your Souls this day be widened and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, they ſhould all of them be filled: open thy mouth never ſo wide, and God will fill it. Oh, do not content your ſelves with a ſmall meaſure of Faith, but labour for a ſtrong and great Faith; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Buckets, ſo ſhall your waters be drawn: <hi>Draw water out of the Wells of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Iſa. 12.3. What are the Wells of Salvation, but God and Jeſus Chriſt, and his Spirit, and the Graces of the Spirit, and the Ordinances of God? theſe are the Wells of Salvation. If you bring
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:45614:204"/>but little Buckets, you will get but little water; if you bring large Buckets, you will get a large deal of water. If you bring but little Faith, you will receive but little from Chriſt; but if you bring a ſtrong Faith, a large and ſtrong Bucket, O how much refreſhing and Soul-ſatisfaction might you receive! There are three benefits which you ſhall have by a ſtrong Faith.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Faith hath this Property, it makes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it toucheth its own; <hi>According to thy Faith be it unto thee,</hi> Matth. 18.13. So if thy Faith do but touch Jeſus Chriſt, it will make him yours; if it do but touch the Promiſes, it makes them yours. The truth is, there hath been a great deal of talk of the Philoſophers ſtone, but I know no other Philoſophers ſtone, but Faith, and this turns all it toucheth into Gold: Bleſſed is the man that by Faith can touch Jeſus Chriſt; no man ever toucht him by Faith, but was healed by Grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You ſhall have this benefit: it will yield you abundance of joy and ſatisfaction in the expectation of your deſires, before you come to the fruition of your deſires. You read of <hi>the joy of Faith,</hi> Phil. 1.25. And the Apoſtle prays for the <hi>Romans,</hi> that their hearts <hi>may be filled with joy and peace in believing,</hi> Rom. 15.13. When <hi>Hannah</hi> had once poured out her Soul before God, now her heart was quieted by Faith, as if ſhe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed her deſires for the preſent, <hi>She went away, and did eat, and her Countenance was no more ſad,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Faith will reallize all the Promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1, <hi>It is the ſubſtance of things hoped for;</hi> it makes things that are abſent, preſent; that are
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:45614:205"/>afar off, to be near at hand; it will bring you to Heaven, before you come to Heaven; O what a precious grace is Faith! And this is the grace you will moſt ſtand in need of, in your approaches to the Lords Table. Now the Lord ſtrengthen this hand of Faith, that by it we may make vigorous applications of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt to our poor Souls, who is the living bread that is able to give fit and full ſatisfaction to our Souls: who is that living water, whereof whoſoever drinketh ſhall thirſt no more.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THeſe words are the words of our Saviour, uttered at that great feaſt, the feaſt of Tabernacles: the occaſion of theſe words was this: The <hi>Jews</hi> marvelled at our Saviour, as you may read <hi>Verſe</hi> 15, <hi>How knoweth this man Letters, having never learned?</hi> That is, how comes he to be ſo skilful in the Scriptures, ſeeing he was never taught by man? Our bleſſed Saviour to this Query anſwers two things:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:45614:206"/>Firſt, He tells them in the foregoing Verſe, the 16th <hi>verſe,</hi> that his Doctrine was not his own, but was taught him of the Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſhews them an excellent way or means, whereby they may diſcern truth from falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, true Doctrine from corrupt Doctrine: namely, by obedience to the will of God; for, <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> So then in the Text, you may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of two particulars:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, An Invitation to a Duty.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, An Encouragement to that Duty.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, An Invitation to a Duty, in theſe words: <hi>If any man will do his will,</hi> that is, that will do the will of God my Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Encouragement to it, in theſe words: <hi>He ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf,</hi> that is, he ſhall know which is true Doctrine, and which is falſe; which is the Doctoctrine accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God and Godlineſs, or what is ſpoken for popular applauſe, and ſpoke of a mans own head: and according to theſe two parts of the Text, there are theſe two Doctrines that may be raiſed from the words:
<list>
                  <item>Doct. 1. <hi>That the true Diſciples of Chriſt are Doers of the will of God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Doct. 2. <hi>That they that do the will of God, ſhall know more of it, and ſhall be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their knowledg.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt, <hi>That the true Diſciples
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:45614:206"/>of Chriſt, or true Chriſtians, are ſuch as are Doers of the will of God.</hi> For the proof of this Doctrine, take two or three places of Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, <hi>Not every one that ſaith to me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> A true Child of God, a true Profeſſor of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is deſcribed by this, he is a Doer of the will of God, <hi>Rom</hi> 2.13, <hi>For not the hearers of the Law are juſt before God, but the doers of the Law ſhall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified:</hi> that is, ſhall be owned and accepted of God the Father. So <hi>James</hi> 1.22, <hi>But be ye Doers of the Word, and not Hearers only, deceiving your own ſouls:</hi> cozening your ſelves with falſe Syllogiſms, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies. If a man be a Hearer of the Word only, and not a Doer of it, he cozens himſelf with falſe arguments: and the like you have in the 25 <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame Chapter; <hi>But whoſo looketh into the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful Hearer, but a Doer of the Word, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed:</hi> the man is a bleſſed Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt. But for the better Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Point, there are three things I ſhall open to you:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, <hi>What is meant by the Will of God?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Seconly, <hi>How the Will of God muſt be done by thoſe that are the Diſciples of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, <hi>Why the Diſciples of Chriſt muſt be Doers of the Will of God?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>What the will of God is?</hi> Not to trouble you with the various diſtinctions of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; briefly, there is a twofold will of God men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture: the one is called <hi>a Secret will,</hi> the other is called <hi>a Revealed will;</hi> you have
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:45614:207"/>them both mentioned in one Verſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29, <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God, but thoſe things which are revealed, belong unto us, and to our Children for ever, that we may do all the words of the Law.</hi> Now our Saviour ſpeaks here in the Text of the Revealed will of God, and it is called <hi>a Revealed will,</hi> becauſe it is made known to us in three Books:
<list>
                  <item>In the Book of Nature.</item>
                  <item>In the Book of the Creature</item>
                  <item>In the Book of the Scripture.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The will of God is made known unto us partly in the Book of Nature. Thus many of the better ſort of Heathens, that had nothing but the light of Nature, by the dictates of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, knew what the will of God was, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15, <hi>For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by Nature the things contained in the Law, theſe having not the Law, are a Law to themſelves, which ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> Mark, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which had not the Law; that is, they had not the Law of Scripture, yet did by Nature the things contained in the Law. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> which had not the Law of the Scripture, yet by the Law of Nature did thoſe things that were agreeable to the will of God, and by the dictates of their own Conſciences, did ſome things that were agreeable to the will of God; and although this light of Nature was not ſufficient to bring
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:45614:207"/>them to Heaven, yet it was ſufficient to leave them without excuſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This will of God is revealed in the Book of the Creature, <hi>viz.</hi> by the works of Gods Creation and Providence, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20, <hi>For the inviſible things of him, from the Creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead; ſo that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe.</hi> So that the light a man may have by Gods works in the Creation, and by his works of Providence, which the Heathen had, this Book of the Creature, is enough to leave him without excuſe; much of Gods will may be read in this Book.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is called <hi>a revealed will,</hi> becauſe it is made known to us in the Book of the Scripture; of this ſpeaks the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.21. Saith he, <hi>make you perfect:</hi> he prays that <hi>God would make them perfect in every good work to do his will,</hi> that is, his will revealed in the Word of God, for there doth the will of God moſt clearly appear; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when our Saviour ſaith here in the Text, <hi>He that doth his will:</hi> that is, he that obeys his Word, and he that makes the Word of God to be the Rule of his walking, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16, <hi>To as many as walk according to this Rule, peace be upon them, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> The Word of God, that is the Rule we ſhould walk by; this is the Pattern or Preſcript of Gods revealed will. That's the firſt Particular.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It may be demanded, <hi>How, or in what manner muſt the will of God be done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer to this, for the right manner of doing the will of God, there are theſe ſeven things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:45614:208"/>Firſt, The will of God muſt be done knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith expreſly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.2, <hi>Alſo that the Soul be without knowledg, it is not good.</hi> All the Services that a man doth, either out of Will-Worſhip, or out of blind Devotion, it is but like the cutting off of a Dogs neck, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3 And therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle bids the <hi>Romans firſt to prove, and know, what is that good and acceptable, and perfect will of God,</hi> Rom. 12.2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The will of God muſt be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly: <hi>By Faith,</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>Abel offered unto God a more excellent Sacrifice than Cain,</hi> Heb. 11.4. It may be <hi>Cain</hi> offered the very ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that <hi>Abel</hi> did, yet <hi>Abel</hi>'s was accepted, and <hi>Cain</hi>'s was rejected, becauſe <hi>Abel</hi> offered in Faith, and <hi>Cain</hi> did not; <hi>For without Faith it is impoſſile to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. You cannot do the will of God without Faith; becauſe it is Faith that brings Jeſus Chriſt in its arms, and ſo makes both our Perſons and Prayers accepted: <hi>No man can come to the Father, but by me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 14.6. And we are ſaid to <hi>offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God,</hi> (how?) <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> they are acceptable only by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Therefore a man muſt do the will of God believingly.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The will of God muſt be done graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, from a principle of grace, from that which is called an inward Principle, as the Apoſtle ſhews expreſly, <hi>Circumciſion avails nothing:</hi> no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledg can make us acceptable with God, but a new Creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15, <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be: ſo then they
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:45614:208"/>that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe Gtd,</hi> Rom. 8.7, 8. A man that is not yet in the ſtate of grace, cannot do the will of God acceptably; the will of God muſt be done graciouſly, from a gracious principle.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The will of God muſt be done cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially, it muſt be done with the heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26, <hi>My Son, give me thy heart.</hi> What is not done with the heart, God reckons as not done at all; therefore the firſt and great Commandment is this, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, with all thy ſtrength; and whatever ye do in word or deed, do it heartily as to the Lord,</hi> Col. 3.16, 17. And the Apoſtle exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Servants, he bids them <hi>Obey their Maſters, not with eye-ſervice, but as doing the will of God from the heart,</hi> Epheſ. 6.6.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The will of God muſt be done ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any ſiniſter or ſelf-reſpect; a man muſt have upright ends and aims in doing the will of God; for God look at our aims, as well as at our actions, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10: <hi>Jehu</hi> did the will of God in deſtroying the Worſhippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> and deſtroying the Children of <hi>Ahab,</hi> God commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jehu</hi> for doing his will; but yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe he aimed at the ſetling of himſelf in the Kingdom, more than ſeeking the glory of God, therefore God looked upon it but as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and ſaid, he <hi>would avenge the blood of Jezerel on the houſe of Jehu,</hi> Hoſ. 1. A man may do that thing that God would have him do, and yet be puniſhed for the doing of it, if his aims and ends be not upright: <hi>Whatever ye do, whether ye eat, or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> faſted and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:45614:209"/>but it was for vain-glory, and it was but to cloak their wickedneſs and iniquity, by a fair co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or pretence of piety; they made long Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and in the mean time devoured Widows houſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.14.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The will of God muſt be done fully, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.24, <hi>And my Servant Caleb, becauſe he had another ſpirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But may be you will ſay, <hi>When doth a man do the will of God fully, or follow God fully?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, When he doth not do it with a divided heart, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10.2, <hi>Their heart is divided, now ſhall they be found faulty.</hi> When a mans heart is divided, partly for God, and partly for the world, then he doth not follow God fully.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Then a man follows God fully, when he hath reſpect to every Command of God, as well as to one Command, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.6, <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect unto all thy Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, When he doth not retain any one ſin, in the love, liking, and approbation of it, but he <hi>hates every falſe way,</hi> Pſal 119.104. You read that God was weary of their New Moons, and their ſolemn Feaſts: <hi>My Soul hates them,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.14. Yet theſe New Moons, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſts were of Gods own inſtitution and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: But why doth God hate them then? the reaſon is this: ſaith God, <hi>Becauſe your hands are full of blood,</hi> full of cruelty and oppreſſion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. Therefore they do not do the will of God tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that retain the love of ſin in their hearts, and this makes their Services rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:45614:209"/>Seventhly, The will of God muſt be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.20, <hi>My Soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy Judgments at all times.</hi> So here, a man muſt have reſpect unto the will of God at all times; but there are three times eſpecially, wherein God calls us to do his will.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In a time of proſperity, when the World with the luſts and vanity of it, are ready to draw away our hearts to it; O then have a care to do Gods will, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.11, 12, <hi>When thou haſt eaten and art full,</hi> (when thou art in a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) <hi>then beware leſt thou forget the Lord which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had learnt a great Leſſon, when he ſaid, <hi>I have learnt in whatſoever ſtate I am in, therewith to be content: I know how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound,</hi> Phil. 4.11, 12. There is more danger in proſperity, than in adverſity: as in a croud, a man is in danger to loſe his Purſe; ſo in a croud of worldly buſineſſes and proſperity, a man is in greateſt danger to loſe his God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In a time of danger, then God calls you to do his will, that you ſhould not decline Duty for danger ſake; that you ſhould not break a Hedg, to miſs a foul way. See a ſingular example of this in <hi>Daniel;</hi> when he knew the doing of his duty would be the hazard of his life, when he knew the writing was ſealed, and that ſnares were laid for his life, yet he would not omit duty for the ſaving of his life; he prayed three times a day, as he was wont to do, his Window being open in his Chamber towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Dan. 6.10. So thoſe three Noble Worthies, who
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:45614:210"/>were ſo highly honoured by God, as to be miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerved, they would not deeline duty for dangers ſake; <hi>Be it known unto thee, O King, our God whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us from this burning Furnace: but if not, we will not ſerve thy gods, nor worſhip the golden Image which thou haſt ſet up,</hi> Dan. 3.17, 18. So ſingular was the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>John,</hi> Acts 4.20, <hi>We cannot but ſpeak the things that we have ſeen, and heard:</hi> Threaten, or not threaten, impriſon, or not impriſon, we cannot but ſpeak the things that we have ſeen and heard.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A third Seaſon when God calls us to do his will, is this: when he puts an opportunity into our hands of doing ſome ſpecial piece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for him; now is a price put into your hands, now a man ſhould do the will of God eſpecially. This is that which <hi>Mordecai</hi> told <hi>Eſther, Eſther</hi> 4, <hi>Who knows whether thou art come to the Kingdom for ſuch a time as this?</hi> It is as if he ſhould ſay, It may be, God hath put an opportunity into thy hand, to help his Church at this time.</p>
            <p>The third thing by way of Explication, is this: <hi>But why muſt the Diſciples of Chriſt be Doers of Gods will?</hi> The Reaſons are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the whole Body of Religion (as I may ſay (conſiſts in theſe two things: namely, in Believing and Obeying; take away one of theſe, and Religion is a lame Religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By doing the will of our Father, we ſhew our ſelves to be Diſciples of Chriſt indeed, becauſe we now imitate our Lord and Maſter, for thus did he; ſee that remarkable Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 6.38, <hi>I came from Heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:45614:210"/>Thirdly, Becauſe if we do not do the will of God, we ſhall certainly do the will of a worſe Maſter; if we do not work in Gods ſervice, we ſhall do the Devils drudgery; if we be not work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of righteouſneſs, we ſhall be workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; as appears by that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, 23, <hi>He that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven, he ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> compare it with <hi>verſe</hi> 23, <hi>And then will I ſay unto them, I never knew you, depart from me ye workers of iniquity.</hi> It is as if our Saviour ſhould ſay, Becauſe you would not be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of righteouſneſs, to do the will of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore it is that you are workers of iniquity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Chriſtians muſt do the will of God, becauſe this is that which makes for the honour of God, <hi>John</hi> 15.8, <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, if ye bring forth much fruit.</hi> Look as by believing, we give honour to the Truth of God; ſo by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we give God the honour of his Soveraignty. <hi>As obedient Children, we ſhall ſhew forth the praiſes of him, who hath called you out of darkneſs into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the Application, there are two or three Objections that lie in the way, which I ſhall endeavour to remove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. It may be, ſome will ſay, <hi>You do ſo cry up Duty, and doing the will of God, that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe or eclipſe the Free grace of God; this is not Preaching Free grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, This is not an infringing, or an eclipſing of the free-grace of God. becauſe you muſt know, Faith and good Works are not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite one to another, but they are ſubordinate, they
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:45614:211"/>are conſiſtent, and may ſtand one with another very well.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, The grace of God doth not exclude all works, but it excludes thoſe works only that are meritorious; Good works there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (we may ſay truly) are Cauſes, without which we cannot be ſaved: though they are not Efficient Cauſes, nor inſtrumental Cauſes, yet they are Cauſes without which we cannot be ſaved; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14; So may I ſay here, Though we be not ſaved for our good works, yet we ſhall never be ſaved without good works: I would have you to remember this: Good works, though they are not neceſſary to our Juſtification, yet they are neceſſary to our Salvation; there is a great deal of difference between theſe two; to be ſaved by faith, and ſaved for faith: this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, we are not ſaved for our faith; this is the errour of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that ſay, The Act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is our righteouſneſs. Though we are not ſaved for faith, yet the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by faith:</hi> So here, we are not ſaved for our good works, yet we are not ſaved without good works, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that is a Doer of the Word, ſhall be bleſſed in his deed,</hi> James 1.25; He doth not ſay <hi>for</hi> his deed: ſo you may be bleſſed <hi>in</hi> your good works, though not for your good works.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer; Although faith alone doth juſtifie, yet that faith that is alone doth not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; though no man is juſtified for his works, yet that faith that is a juſtifying faith, is a working faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:45614:211"/>Secondly, It may be objected: <hi>But why do you preſs us to do the will of God, when of our ſelves we are not able to do it; we cannot of our ſelves think a good thought, nor ſpeak a good word: much leſs do the will of God in that manner as you have laid down how it muſt be done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer; Our inability doth not nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie or make void the Commands of God: God (for example) bids you believe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23, <hi>And this is his Commandment, that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and yet <hi>Faith it is the gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2.8, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not of your ſelves believe. So Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> he bid <hi>Simon Magus</hi> pray, <hi>that his ſins may be forgiven him;</hi> and yet notwithſtanding, no man is able of himſelf to pray in an acceptable manner; ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We know not how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit helps our infirmities,</hi> Rom. 28.6. But the <hi>Arminians</hi> they ſtretch the Objection yet a little further, and argue thus:</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>If God commands us to do what we are not able to perform, then this is cruelty in God;</hi> and they give you an inſtance. <hi>For example</hi> (ſay they) <hi>If you tie a mans hands and bid him work, or cut off his legs ard bid him walk, this is a great deal of cruelty;</hi> ſo ſay they, <hi>If God bid us do his will, and we have no freedom nor ability to do his will, then this is cruelty in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, It is true indeed, if God ſhould tie our hands, or cut off our legs, then this Objection would be of ſome weight; but God doth not do ſo: God at firſt <hi>made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> he gave us ability to do his will; but if we have loſt that ability, we cannot blame God, but our ſelves: <hi>our deſtruction is from our ſelves,</hi>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:45614:212"/>our inability to do Duty, is from our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer; Natural and unregenerate men, though they cannot work grace in their own hearts, yet they may do ſomething in a tendency to grace; they may wait on the means of grace, they may hear as they are able, and pray as they are able, and do Duties as they are able; they may wait upon God, as they did in <hi>Acts</hi> 2, when they cryed out, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> (1 Cor. 14.24, 25.) They may come to the Aſſemblies of Gods Saints, as that ignorant and Unbeliever did, though for the preſent he was in a ſtate of ignorance and unbelief, yet by hearing the Word preached, he was convinced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Men are not damned for Can-nots, but for Will-nots; men are not damned becauſe they can do no better, but becauſe they will do no better.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer; Though we do not work with God, yet God will not work without us; God ſaves no man againſt his will, God carries no man to Heaven as a Sack is carried to the Market on Horſe-back; but God ſaves a man by bowing and bending his will, and of unwilling, making him willing. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Qui ſine auxilio tuo te Creavit, contra voluntatem tuam te non ſalvabit;</hi> He that made thee without thee, will not ſave thee without thee.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I anſwer this Objection of the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> thus: When our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that doth the will of my Father, he ſhall know of the Doctrine;</hi> and he ſuppoſeth that ſuch a man hath grace in his heart, that doth enable him to do the will of God. Though it is true, an unregenerate man hath no freedom of will to do good; yet this is a certain truth, that the regenerate, ſo far as they are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:45614:212"/>have freedom of will to do good.</p>
            <p>Now for the Uſe and Application of this Point, briefly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Information: <hi>If the Diſciples of Chriſt are, or ſhould be Doers of Gods will,</hi> then it follows, he that would be a true Diſciple of Chriſt, muſt be a ſelf-denying Chriſtian; it was that I proved to you at large in many Sermons, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. He that will be a true Chriſtian, muſt be a ſelf-denyer; but why ſo? it appears plainly: If the Diſciple of Chriſt muſt be a Doer of Gods will; then</p>
            <p>Firſt, He muſt not do his own will, but he muſt deny himſelf in that: he muſt not walk in his own way, he muſt not live by his own rule, he muſt not proſecute his own ends, but he muſt do all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of his Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If he muſt do Gods will; then he muſt not fulfil the will of the fleſh, and of the mind, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3, <hi>They that are Chriſts</hi> Diſciples, <hi>have crucified the fleſh, together with the affections and luſts of it,</hi> Gal. 5.24.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If he muſt do Gods will, then he muſt not do the will of men, he muſt not ſeek to pleaſe men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10, <hi>Or do I ſeek to pleaſe men? for if I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, If he muſt make the will of God his Rule, then he muſt not make Providence his Rule, nor the impulſe of the Spirit, as they are uſually called.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He muſt not make Providence his Rule, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.7, 8, 9: <hi>David,</hi> he had opportunity of killing <hi>Saul,</hi> who was his deadly enemy; <hi>Saul</hi> was now aſleep in the Cave: he might have ſaid, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:45614:213"/>here is the Providence of God, he hath put my enemy into my hand; but <hi>David</hi> would not make Providence his Rule, becauſe he had not a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Word of God to do any ſuch thing. I would have you to remember this Rule; To fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Providence without the Word is dangerous, to follow it againſt the Word is damnable; but to follow Providence with the Word, that is ſafe and warrantable.—Neither muſt the impulſe of the Spirit be the Rule of your walking. <hi>David</hi> had ſo ſtrong impulſe on his Spirit to deſtroy <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> and his Family, for his churliſhneſs to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being in diſtreſs, becauſe he would not ſpare them neceſſaries when he ſent unto him, that he ſaid, <hi>God do ſo to me, and more alſo, if I leave any of Nabals Family and not cut off all that piſſeth againſt the Wall,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. But upon the good counſel of <hi>Abigail, Nabals</hi> Wife, he recollected himſelf, and ſaw that it was not the will of God that he ſhould do ſo; but he bleſſed God that he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him from his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Learn another Leſſon by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerence, and that is this: The life of true Religion conſiſts not in ſaying, but in doing; it conſiſts not in profeſſion, but in practice: When a man hath the Word of life in his mouth, and the life of the Word in his Converſation, then he is a Chriſtian indeed. It's not the talking, but the walking Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; not he that talks of the way to Heaven, and that talks of Chriſtianity, but he that walks in the way that leads to Eternal life. This will prove you to be Chriſtians of a right ſtamp.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Learn this Leſſon, That the will of God is the perfect Rule of Righteouſneſs. A thing is therefore good becauſe God wills it, for God
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:45614:213"/>cannot will any thing that is not good; all his ways are equal, though our ways are unequal; all his paths are righteouſneſs: therefore whatever God commands, it muſt therefore needs be good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wills it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Learn this Leſſon: If Chriſtians muſt be Doers of Gods will, then it follows, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is proud, ſtubborn, and diſobedient, willingly reſiſting the Commands of God, ſuch certainly cannot be the Diſciples of Chriſt: they that fulfil their own wills, and they that walk in their own ways, and after their own wills, and after the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of their own hearts: and they that fulfil the luſts of the fleſh, and of the eye, thoſe are no Diſciples of Chriſt: for the Diſciples of Chriſt are Doers of the will of God. O hear, and fear, all you voluptuous ones, that deny your own hearts nothing: as it was ſaid of <hi>Adoniah, David denyed him nothing.</hi> You that pamper the fleſh, and you that ſtudy more to pleaſe men, than to pleaſe the great God of Heaven and Earth; Know aſſuredly, for the preſent you are no true Chriſtians, no Diſciples of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Uſe it is by way of Examination: (If time would give leave, I might preſs this Uſe home upon you) You may call your ſelves to account, whether you be in the number of thoſe that do the will of God, or no; whether you do it in a right manner; whether you do it knowingly: there is a great deal of knowledg, and yet there is but a little knowledg; there is a great deal of confuſed knowledg, but there is but little ſound, ſavoury, experimental, diſtinct knowledg of God. Do you do the will of God believingly? There is much talking of the grace of Faith, but little living the life
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:45614:214"/>of Faith.—Do you do the will of God graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, from a principle of grace? It is one thing for a Jack or Clock that hath a conſtrained motion, to go: and another thing, for a man that walks and moves by a principle of life that is within. Do you duties from an inward principle of grace? And do you do the will of God cordially from the heart? And do you do the will of God ſincerely, aiming at the honour and glory of God? And do you do it fully and conſtantly? Do not theſe Queſtions puzzle many of you? What ſatisfactory anſwer can your Conſciences give to ſuch Interrogatories as theſe are? Happy is the man that with a good Conſcience can give anſwer to theſe Queſtions: that can ſay, <hi>It is the deſire of my heart in ſincerity, to do the will of God fully and conſtantly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, For a cloſe of this firſt Point, with a word of Exhortation: I beſeech you, as you would be Diſciples of Chriſt, ſet upon this work of doing the will of God; and here let me ſhew you ſome Rules and Directions:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Would you do the will of God? then ſhake off ſecurity, and ſlothfulneſs, and formality, and coldneſs in Religion; formality eats out the heart of Religion: <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> ſtrive as in an Agony, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you do in the ſervice of God, do it with all your might. It was the great commendation of that good King <hi>Hezekiah, That in every work that he began in the ſervice of the Houſe of God, and in the Law, and in the Commandements, to ſeek his God, he did it with all his heart,</hi> 2 Chron. 31.21.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Labour for a ſtrong Faith, for Faith is the Nurſe of Obedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8, <hi>By Faith Abraham obeyed God;</hi> and he obeyed him in as
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:45614:214"/>hard Commands as ever you heard of, which was to leave his Countrey, to leave his own Habitation, and all that he had, and to go into a ſtrange Land, into a place he knew not whither: another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that he obeyed was in the ſacrificing of his deareſt and only Son <hi>Iſaac: By Faith he obeyed God.</hi> And you read of <hi>the Obedience of Faith,</hi> Rom. 16.26.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, would you do the will of God? then ſet about it without delay; <hi>To day, if you will hear his voyce, harden not your hearts,</hi> Heb. 3.7. <hi>I made haſte, and delayed not to keep thy Commandments,</hi> Pſalm 119.60.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Study Self-denial: croſs your own wills, that Gods will may be fulfilled; all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between God and ſuch poor worms as we are, is this: <hi>Whether Gods will or ours ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed?</hi> Study Self-denial; for, if Gods will, and your will meet upon a narrow Bridg, and one muſt give way to the other, if you be not well bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſted with ſelf-denial, you will croſs Gods will, to do your own.</p>
            <p>Now let me lay before you ſome Motives to quicken you to do the will of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I beſeech you to remember this: This doing of the will of God, will prove you to be the Children of God, that you have God to be your Father. O what an honour is it to have God to be your Father! It is more than if you had all the Kingdoms of the world in your poſſeſſion for ſo many thouſand years. This doing of the will of God, will ſhew you to be the true Children of God; for, how doth our Saviour prove thoſe ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born <hi>Jews</hi> to be the children of the Devil? <hi>John</hi> 8.44, <hi>You are of your father the Devil, and the will
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:45614:215"/>of your father you will do;</hi> You do the Devils will, and therefore you are the Devils children. So here, if you do the will of your Heavenly Father, it is a plain token that you are his Children.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider what a high price and eſteem you ſhall be in with the Lord Chriſt himſelf, by doing the will of God; conſider what a high price the Lord Chriſt will put upon you; you ſhall be related to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>ult. For whoſoever ſhall do the will of my Father which is in Heaven, the ſame is my Brother, and Siſter, and Mother.</hi> Chriſt looks upon ſuch a one in near relation to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider, this is that which will yield you Honey and ſweetneſs in all conditions, if you be eareful to do the will of your Heavenly Father, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 63.5, <hi>My Soul ſhall be ſatisfied as with Marrow and Fatneſs.</hi> And that is an excellent Scripture, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.56, <hi>This I had becauſe I kept thy Precepts: This I had,</hi> what is that? This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort I had, this ſupportation I had in all my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: this conſolation I had, this ſweet Communion with God I had; why? <hi>becauſe I kept thy Precepts,</hi> I obeyed thy will. Look how much Obedience is yielded to the Commands of God, ſo much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort doth flow into the Soul; God uſually gives in Comforts proportionably to our Obedience. Oh the ſweet Soul-ſatisfying Conſolation a Child of God finds in the ways of God, and in doing the will of God! eſpecially when he lies on his death-bed, then it will be ſweeter to him than the Hony &amp; the Hony-comb: then will he ſay with good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he lay upon his death-bed; <hi>Lord, Remember how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which was good in thy ſight.</hi> Oh that ſweet ſatisfaction
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:45614:215"/>that a Soul ſhall find in God, when he comes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God!</p>
            <p>Then here is one Motive more in the Text, and that is the next Point I ſhall come unto, the great encouragement that he ſhall have in doing the will of God; for, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>He that doth the will of God, he ſhall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> This is the Point I ſhall ſpeak to next time, <hi>They that are the Doers of the will of God, ſhall know more of his will, and ſhall be more aſſured of what his will is.</hi>

                  <p>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>NOW I come to the ſecond Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is principally and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially held forth in this Text, and it is this:
<q>That he that doth the will of God, ſhall know more of it, and ſhall be more aſſured of what he knows.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For the better handling of this weighty Truth, uttered by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it will not be amiſs to divide the Doctrine into two Branches, or into two Propoſitions, and to ſpeak diſtinctly to each of them:
<list>
                  <item>The firſt Branch of the Doctrine, is this: <hi>He that doth the will of God ſhall know more of his will.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The ſecond, is this: <hi>He that doth the will of God ſhall be more aſſured of what he knows.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt Propoſition, or the firſt Branch of the Doctrine: <hi>He that doth the will of God, ſhall know more of his will.</hi> God will reveal himſelf more fully, more clearly, to ſuch a Soul as is careful to live up to his light, to walk according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:45614:216"/>of knowledg he hath received; this is that our Saviour promiſeth, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.12, <hi>For whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance; but whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away, even that which he hath. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath, to him ſhall be given:</hi> What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this? That is, as learned <hi>Pareus</hi> well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the place, He that hath the beginning of ſaving knowledg, and ſound Converſion, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Faith and Obedience, <hi>To him ſhall be given.</hi> What ſhall be given? There ſhall be given an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of that knowledg, an encreaſe of that faith, an encreaſe of that love, an encreaſe of that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: <hi>Whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given.</hi> But on the contrary, <hi>Whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away, that he ſeemeth to have:</hi> that is, from Hypocrites that make a fair ſhew, as if they had grace, ſaving knowledg, true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the like: from him ſhall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that he ſeemeth to have. This is an excellent Scripture to prove the perſeverance of the Saints, they ſhall encreaſe in grace; but then on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it proves the warping, declining, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering condition of Hypocrites, they ſhall grow worſe and worſe, and loſe thoſe gifts that they have. The <hi>Arminians</hi> they make a wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and interpretation of this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for they ſay, <hi>He that hath, and well improves his natural parts and abilities, he deſerves the gift of ſaving grace.</hi> This is their Expoſition, <hi>He that well uſeth the gift of Nature, doth deſerve of God the gift of ſaving grace;</hi> this is a falſe Expoſition, and a reaſoning againſt Reaſon; for our Saviours words muſt be underſtood thus; <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given.</hi> He that well uſeth the gifts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:45614:217"/>true indeed, he ſhall have an encreaſe of the gifts of Nature; for example, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and the better ſort of Heathen, well uſing the gifts of Nature, had the gifts of Nature encreaſed, and they grew to be excellent men, ſo far as the light of nature would carry them, God gave them an encreaſe of the gifts of Nature; but now, he that well uſeth the gifts of grace, to him ſhall be given, he ſhall have an encreaſe of thoſe gifts of grace. Hitherto tends that excellent paſſage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 25.12, <hi>What man is he that fearcth the Lord? him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chuſe.</hi> Mark this Scripture well; That man that conſcientiouſly walketh in the fear of the Lord, and in obedience to his Commands, he ſhall have more light, and more direction from the God of his Salvation; God will teach him, and God will direct him, and God will enable him to walk in a way that is well-pleaſing in his ſight; that God whom he fears, will guide and direct him to walk in paths of righteouſneſs. So in <hi>verſe</hi> 14, of the ſame <hi>Pſalm, The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> A marvellous ſweet and comfortable Scripture! <hi>The ſecret of the Lord:</hi> that is, God will reveal ſome ſecret, ſome myſterie of his, ſome myſteries of grace, and of the power of grace, <hi>to thoſe that do fear him,</hi> and conſcientiouſly practiſe what they know; God will (as I may ſay) make them of his Privy-Council: they ſhall be acquainted with ſome ſecrets of God, that others are not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with: and the Prophet here inſtances in one ſecret, <hi>God will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> O what a ſweet Promiſe is that! God will ſhew them the excellency and ſweetneſs of the Covenant of grace;
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:45614:217"/>that Covenant <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my Houſe be not ſo with God.</hi> Alas, I have had many failings, failings in my Political Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and failings in my Domeſtical Relations, as a King, as a Maſter, as a Father; though my Houſe be not ſo with God, though it hath not been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as it ſhould be, <hi>yet he hath made with me a Covenant, ſure and ſtedfast, and ordered in all things aright.</hi> Never mortal man was ſaved by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; all that have been, and all that ſhall be ſaved, were and ſhall be ſaved by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. Now, that man that feareth God, God will ſhew him the Covenant of grace, and God will ſhew that man the unconceivable beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſweetneſs, and all-ſufficiency that is in Jeſus Chriſt! God will ſhew to ſuch a man the marvellous ſweet, and ſecret contentment that is in the power of Godlineſs! God will ſhew ſuch a man the invaluable comforts of his Spirit, the Sweet-meats of Heaven, thoſe Soul-raviſhing, and Soul-ſatisfying comforts that delight the Soul. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 94.19, <hi>Thy Comforts delight my Soul.</hi> God will ſhew ſuch a man the tranſcendent excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of thoſe glorious hopes that are laid up in Heaven for the Saints in light. Thus the <hi>ſecrets of the Lord are with them that fear him.</hi> Some ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets and myſteries that are not ſhewn to the World, God will reveal to all thoſe that fear his Name, that do conſcientiouſly walk before him, that live up to their light. And what a ſweet and precious Promiſe is that, which our Saviour made in <hi>John</hi> 14.21, <hi>He that hath my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keeps them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> Mark,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:45614:218"/>that man that loves God, and that walks in a way of obedience, that lives up to his light, that doth the will of God, he ſhall know more of Jeſus Chriſt, Jeſus Chriſt will more fully manifeſt himſelf unto him, I will love him, and I will manifeſt my ſelf unto him, he ſhall have more diſcoveries of my love. To name but one Scripture more: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, <hi>But grow in grace, and in the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe two go together: if you grow in grace, certainly you ſhall grow in knowledg; if you grow in obedience, certainly your obedience ſhall encreaſe your knowledg in the myſteries of God.</p>
            <p>For the Explication of the Doctrine, two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries there are that would be ſatisfied:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, <hi>How, or in what reſpect our obedience ſhall encreaſe our knowledg?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, <hi>How it comes to paſs, or what reaſon can be rendred, why the obedient Chriſtian ſhall know more of Gods will?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>How, or in what reſpect our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall encreaſe our knowledg? He that obeys the will of God, ſhall know more of his will.</hi> How ſhall he know more?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, The knowledg of an obedient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhall be encreaſed in three reſpects:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, In regard of its Subject.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, In regard of its Object.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, In regard of the Manner of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The knowledg of an obedient Chriſtian ſhall be encreaſed in the Subject of it, or the Seat of it where it is placed, as I may call it; now the Seat of knowledg is the mind of man, the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual part of man: his intellectual faculty ſhall be enlarged by his obedience, it ſhall be made
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:45614:218"/>more capable of receiving Heavenly truths than it was before. God will enlarge that mans underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: whereas before he was but a Babe in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and underſtanding, now he ſhall be a grown man; whereas before he could not digeſt Milk, now he ſhall be able to digeſt ſtrong Meat; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before he was but faint and feeble in knowledg, now he ſhall be ſtrong like <hi>David,</hi> Zech. 12.8, <hi>In that day ſhall the Lord defend the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and he that is feeble among them at that day, ſhall be as David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The knowledg of an obedient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhall be encreaſed and enlarged in the Object of it; the Object I call thoſe matters or things that are to be known: ſuch a one ſhall know more truths, more myſteries of Godlineſs, more of Gods ſecrets, he ſhall have more manifeſtations of the Spirit of God revealed to him, more diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Truth from day to day: it is that which God hath promiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9, <hi>The Earth ſhall be full of the knowledg of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea.</hi> The Prophet ſpeaks of a larger meaſure of knowledg, and further diſcoveries of truths than was wont to be made.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The knowledg of an obedient Chriſtian ſhall be encreaſed in regard of the Manner of knowledg; he ſhall know the Truths of God in a better manner than he was wont to do: <hi>How is that?</hi> you will ſay. I anſwer, and ſhall give you an inſtance in five particulars:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, He ſhall know truths more inwardly.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, He ſhall know truths more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, He ſhall know truths more transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="410" facs="tcp:45614:219"/>Fourthly, He ſhall know truths more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, He ſhall know truths more ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, An obedient Chriſtian ſhall know truths more inwardly, more feelingly than he was wont to do; not only have a bare apprehenſion, but ſuch a knowledg as ſhall take an impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart: and therefore this inward know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is compared to ſeeing, and to taſting, and to ſmelling.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is compared to. Seeing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8, 9, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, is this grace given, that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſearchable Riches of Chriſt; and to make all men ſee</hi> (not only know, but ſee) <hi>what is the fellowſhip of the myſterie which from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world hath been hid in God, who Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things by Jeſus Chuiſt.</hi> The <hi>Italian</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion renders it, that all men may ſee what was the diſpenſation of the Myſterie which was hid from the beginning of the World, which God was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hide in himſelf from the beginning of the World, that all men may ſee. I quote that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to prove, that inward Knowledg is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Seeing, and Seeing is more than a bare Report, according to that of <hi>Job,</hi> Job 42.15, <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee, I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This inward Knowledg is compared to <hi>Taſting,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.3, <hi>If ſo be that ye have taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Lord is gracious.</hi> Taſting is more than Knowing, and Taſting is more than Seeing. If all the Orators in the World ſhould deſcribe what
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:45614:219"/>the ſweetneſs of Honey is, they could not do it ſo well as a man that taſts it. Now the Soul comes to taſt the ſweetneſs that is in Jeſus Chriſt. Notional knowledg is one thing, and Taſting knowledg is another thing; they have a feeling, experimental knowledg in their own hearts. That is another.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This inward Knowledg is compared, not only to Seeing, and Taſting, but it is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Smelling alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.3, <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord ſhall make him of quick underſtanding in the fear of the Lord:</hi> So the words are read; but the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe carries it thus, and ſo it is in the Margin of your Bibles, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall make him of quick ſcent, or ſmell, in the fear of the Lord:</hi> That is, a man that is once taught by the Spirit of God, that is <hi>taught of God,</hi> as our Saviour uſeth the Phraſe, ſuch a man ſhall ſcent, and ſmell, and ſavour, and breathe out nothing but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. As our Saviour, it is ſaid of him, <hi>All thy garments ſmell of Myrrh, and Aloes, and Caſſia,</hi> Pſalm 45.8, <hi>And becauſe of the ſavour of thy good Ointments, thy Name is as Ointment poured forth,</hi> Cant. 1.3. Look as the Ointment that was poured on our Saviours head, left ſuch a ſcent or ſmell behind it, that the whole houſe was filled with the ſavour of it, <hi>John</hi> 12.3. So is it in this caſe; a man that hath once received the Spirit of God, and is taught by the Spirit of God, ſuch a man ſhall have ſuch a ſweet ſavour of the knowledg of God, that it ſhall be able to diffuſe it ſelf to others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bleſſeth God for this, that <hi>he cauſed them to triumph in Chriſt, and made manifeſt the ſavour of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg by them in every place.</hi> And our Latin word
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:45614:220"/>for Wiſdom, <hi>Sapientia,</hi> it hath its derivation from this, it is a ſavoury Knowledg. So that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Knowledg, is more than bare apprehenſion: it is you ſee compared to Seeing, Touching, and to Smelling.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſhall know truths more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally than he did before; and this is that you read of, <hi>John</hi> 4.42: It is the ſpeech of the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> to the woman that had left her Water-pot, and went into the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and declared to them of the City, what ſhe had heard and ſeen concerning Chriſt; <hi>Now</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we believe not for thy ſayings, for we have heard him our ſelves, and know that this indeed is the Chriſt, the Saviour of the world.</hi> And thus likewiſe did the Diſciples make a Confeſſion of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.69, <hi>And we believe, and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, An obedient Chriſtian ſhall know truths more transformingly: that is, he ſhall be transformed into the very Image of thoſe truths that he knows, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. But we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> That is, we are changed from one degree of grace unto another, by the Spirit of God. That is an excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that is a transforming knowledg, that makes a Chriſtian have a heart framed into the Word of God: that is caſt into the Mould of the Doctrine of the Word of God made like unto it: as Lead that is melted and caſt into a Mould, is of the ſhape of the Mould, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17, <hi>But ye have obeyed from the heart, that form of Doctrine which was delivered you,</hi> or, <hi>into which ye were delivered or caſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:45614:220"/>Fourthly, An obedient Chriſtian ſhall know truths more powerfully than he did before, that thoſe truths which he knows ſhall over-awe his heart, that he dare do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8, <hi>For we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the truth, but for the truth.</hi> Acts 4.20, <hi>We cannot but ſpeak the things which we have heard and ſeen.</hi> It was an excellent ſpeech of Saint <hi>Hierom, I can die for the truth, but I cannot deny the truth, nor be ſilent;</hi> whereas another man, it may be he can oppoſe the truth, and the ways of truth, though he knows he ought not to do it; it may be, another man can break his Vows, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and Promiſes, and Proteſtations, although he knows the ſin of Covenant-breaking is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſin, and ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed, as appears by that remarkable Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.15, 16: Where it is teſtified of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> that after he had made a Covenant with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> he rebelled againſt him; and ſaith God, <hi>Shall he proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he that doth ſuch things as theſe are? ſhall he prolong his days? He hath broken his Covenant, ſaith God, ſhall he be delivered? As I live, ſaith the Lord, he ſhall die in that Land for his Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking.</hi> So I ſay, a man may have ſo much knowledg, that he knows ſuch and ſuch things are ſin, and he may know <hi>the Judgment of God, that they that do ſuch things, are worthy of death:</hi> yet they do it, and take pleaſure in them that do it. For example: They know that Whoredom is a ſin, and a damnable ſin, that carries thouſands to Hell: <hi>Stollen waters are ſweet, and bread eaten in ſecret is pleaſant; but he knoweth not that the dead are there, and that her Gueſts are in the depths of Hell,</hi> Prov. 9.17, 18. Thoſe works
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:45614:221"/>of darkneſs are pleaſant for a while; but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils banquet, ſhall have the Devils ſhot. Though a wicked man knows that whoredom is a ſin, yet his knowledg is ſo weak, that it hath no powerful influence upon his heart and life; but now an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Chriſtian, he ſhall know truths ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that they ſhall have an awe upon his Soul. Thus was it with the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 119.161, <hi>Princes have perſecuted me without a cauſe, but my heart stands in awe of thy Word.</hi> That is the fourth: an obedient Chriſtian knows truths more powerfully.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He that doth the will of God for the manner of his Knowledg, ſhall know truths more ſatisfyingly, to overſway all Objections that are made againſt him, and all diſcouragements that he meets with in the way of holineſs. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us how it was with him in this regard, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16, <hi>When it pleaſed God to reveal Jeſus Chriſt in me.</hi> That phraſe <hi>[in me]</hi> is very remarkable. A man may have Jeſus Chriſt revealed to him, and yet not revealed in him; but when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Chriſt in me, <hi>immediately I conſulted not with fleſh and blood;</hi> but this Knowledg did preponder and out-weigh all Objections that could be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Another man that hath but a weak and feeble knowledg, it may be, he takes check at the ways of holineſs: and what ſays he? If I walk in a ſtrict way, and am circumſpect and careful in ordering my converſation, I ſhall be ſcorned, and oppoſed, and contemned; and theſe his Objections prevails with him. A man now, on the other ſide, that is taught of God, is able to anſwer all theſe Objections, and to paſs through good report, and ill report. This is the firſt thing, for Explication.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:45614:221"/>Secondly, By way of Explication, it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: <hi>But how comes it to paſs that obedient Chriſtians ſhall know more than others?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer to this, I ſhall give you theſe four Reaſons for it:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe God hath promiſed the Holy Ghoſt to them that obey him, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31, 32, <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins; and we are his witneſſes of theſe things, and ſo is alſo the Holy Ghoſt, whom God hath given to them that obey him:</hi> You muſt underſtand it aright. God doth not promiſe the Holy Ghoſt for our obedience, but in a way of obedience; now if God give his Spirit to them that obey him, then they ſhall have more <hi>knowledg,</hi> they ſhall <hi>know more of his will;</hi> for the Spirit of God is a Spirit of light, and opens our underſtanding. The Spirit of God is a teaching Spirit, and they that are taught by the Spirit of God, ſhall certainly come to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.45, <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of God; every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me,</hi> Iſa. 54.13. — And the Spirit of God is a leading Spirit, <hi>The Spirit will lead you into all Truth;</hi> the Spirit will not only take you by the hand, but lead you in the way that you ſhould walk in. As you lead your children when you teach them to go, ſo the Spirit will lead you into all truth; that man to whom the Spirit of God is given, muſt certainly needs know more of the Myſtery of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A ſecond Reaſon is this, Becauſe God hath made many Promiſes to the obedient: how many precious Promiſes have you in that one
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:45614:222"/>Scripture? <hi>Deut.</hi> 28, <hi>If thou ſhalt hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently unto the voyce of the Lord thy God, to obſerve and to do all his Commandements; then the Lord thy God will ſet thee on high, above all the Nations of the Earth, and all theſe bleſſings ſhall come upon thee; bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the City, and in the Field, and in the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and an the fruit of thy Cattel, and thy Kine, and the Flocks of thy Sheep; and bleſſed ſhall be thy basket, and thy ſtore; bleſſed ſhalt thou be when thou comeſt in, and when thou goeſt out,</hi> &amp;c. There are bleſſings of all ſorts promiſed, and among others this is one: for ſaith our Saviour, <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given;</hi> and it is twice repeated in one Evangeliſt, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.12, and <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.29, <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given;</hi> he that well uſeth his Talent, ſhall have more Talents given to him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe God doth love to reward his Servants. Juſt as a Maſter deals with his Factor beyond the Seas, when he ſees that he deals faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with him in ſmaller matters, he intruſts him with more of his Eſtate; ſo when God ſees us faithful in a little, he truſts us with more; when he ſees us to uſe one talent well, he will give us five talents to trade with.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the more grace is acted, the more it grows and is encreaſed. Remarkable is that Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. But ſtrong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even thoſe who by reaſon of uſe, have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil;</hi> By reaſon of uſe have their ſpiritual ſenſes exerciſed. Uſe legs, as we ſay, and have legs: the more a man ſets about this Heavenly Employment of acting of grace, the more grace he ſhall have in his heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:45614:222"/>Now for the Application of this Point, and firſt by way of Inſtruction: it ſerves to let you ſee what is the reaſon of that truth which carnal men will hardly helieve, That Godly men are the only wiſe men, and that wicked men though they are never ſo knowing, are errant fools: this is a truth plainly ſet down in this Scripture: <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 9.10. None are wiſe but thoſe that fear the Lord; none are prudent in Gods account, but thoſe that are obedient, thoſe that practiſe what they know: practical Chriſtians, are the only prudent Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in Gods account. Remarkable is that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.5, 6, <hi>Behold, I have taught you Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Judgments, even as the Lord my God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me, that ye ſhould do ſo in the Land whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye go to poſſeſs. Keep therefore and do them, for this is your wiſdom and underſtanding in the ſight of the Nations, that ſhall hear theſe Statutes, and ſay, Surely this great Nation is a wiſe and underſtanding People.</hi> But now on the contrary, wicked men, let them have never ſo much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, let them have as much knowledg as the wicked Angels, who are knowing Spirits (the Devils are intelligent Spirits) if he do not put his knowledg into practiſe: if he be a wicked man, he is in Gods account an errant fool, he is but a very Sot: <hi>He is in darkneſs, and walketh in darkneſs, and knoweth not whither he goeth, becauſe darkneſs hath blinded his eyes,</hi> 1 John 2.11.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Uſe it is by way of Exhortation: and let it be a powerful perſwaſion to every one here preſent: and Oh that I could leave this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation warm upon your hearts! Oh that I could put you upon the practiſe of what you have
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:45614:223"/>heard: I beſeech you, as ever you deſire that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould take you by the hand, and kiſs you with the kiſſes of his mouth, and manifeſt his love to you; as ever you deſire that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould make fuller diſcoveries of himſelf to you, labour to practiſe what you know: live up to your light, do not foſter or favour any known ſin; nor bauk nor decline any known Duty; but live up to your light. Now that I may preſs you to it, conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, We live in times of Libertiniſm and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein many hold the truth in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt them that impriſon the Truth,</hi> that ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of their knowledg and Conſcience, that blow out the Candle, leſt it ſhould diſcover truth to them: <hi>Light is come into the world, but men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil,</hi> John 3.19, <hi>And this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> to them with a witneſs, who ſhut the light out of their Souls: <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, who hold the truth in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1.18. Let me ſet on this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with this Motive.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider how little it is that we know of God: The very beſt of Gods Saints and Servants, how little do they know of him! To uſe <hi>Jobs</hi> phraſe, <hi>Job</hi> 26. <hi>ult. How little a portion is heard of him!</hi> What a little knowledg is it, that the moſt knowing men have? There is a thouſand times more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and ſulneſs, and ſweetneſs, and Soul-ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and beauty, and all ſufficiency in God, in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, than ever yet was known or diſcovered; <hi>How little a portion do we know of God!</hi>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:45614:223"/>The greateſt part of our knowledg, is the leaſt part of our ignorance: we are ignorant of a thouſand times more than we know. There are <hi>unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. There is a thouſand times more riches in Chriſt than ever was diſcovered: Mines of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledg, that you were never yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: now if you would know more, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe what you do know.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider, the more you know of God, the nearer do you come to Heaven; for the fulneſs of the Saints happineſs in Heaven will be this, when they ſhall ſee God as he is, and know him as he is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2, <hi>Beloved now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be: but we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Beatifical Viſion of God; a ſight of God, ſeeing of him as he is in Heaven. <hi>David</hi> gives you a glimpſe of Heaven in one Verſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17. <hi>ult. As for me, I will behold thy face in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi> Heaven conſiſts in the Viſion of God; in conformity to God, and in ſatisfaction in God: this is Heaven. Viſion of God, <hi>I will behold thy face in righteouſneſs;</hi> Conformity to God, <hi>When I awake with thy likeneſs;</hi> Satisfaction in God, <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied;</hi> then our Knowledg will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider, that this experimental Knowledg that ſprings from Obedience, will make you ſound and ſolid Chriſtians, that you ſhall not take up Religion upon truſt: but you ſhall know upon what grounds you believe, upon what grounds you have the hope of eternal happineſs:
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:45614:224"/>you ſhall not have your Religion upon truſt or Tradition: you ſhall have a certain evidence of your intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, and your hope of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſs; you ſhall be able to read your names written in Heaven. On the contrary, take away that experimental Knowledg that ſprings from Obedience: and a man may be a <hi>Turk</hi> upon the ſame ground that he is a Chriſtian, becauſe he takes his Religion upon truſt. Take away this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Knowledg, a man may be of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as well as a Chriſtian. O get this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that ſprings from Obedience, then you will know upon what grounds you take up Religion; and your hopes of Heaven and happineſs will be upon good grounds.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider, God looks upon all your Knowledg as nothing worth, unleſs you practiſe what you know, and live up to your light; God looks upon all your Praying, and Reading, and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Communicating, as nothing, if ſo be you do not live up to what you know, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.23, <hi>And they came in and poſſeſſed it, but they obeyed not thy voyce, neither walked in thy Law: they have done nothing of all that thou commandedſt them to do.</hi> What, had they done nothing that God commanded them to do? they had circumciſed their Children in obedience to Gods Command; they offered Sacrifices, they came to the Temple, they did many ſpecious outward Duties: but ſaith the Prophet, <hi>They did nothing of all that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them:</hi> Why? becauſe they did not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe what they knew, their lives were not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the profeſſion they made; therefore God eſteemed their profeſſion, no profeſſion; God eſteemed their Sacrifices, no Sacrifices: take your
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:45614:224"/>Sacrifices to your ſelves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20, <hi>Your new Moons, and your Sabbaths, and ſolemn Aſſemblies, I am weary of them,</hi> ſaith God; <hi>they are an abomination unto me.</hi> All their outward profeſſions were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe they did not practiſe what they knew. It is ſaid of the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> that <hi>they were ſons of Belial, they knew not the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.12. It may be thou mayſt have a great deal of notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knowledg: thy tongue may be ſo tip'd with Religion, that thoumayſt be able to diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Points of Religion very judiciouſly: thou mayſt be able to give an account of thy Faith, thou mayſt to able to anſwer an Argument, thou mayſt be able to defend the Truth; yet, if ſo be thou doſt not live according to thy knowledg, in Gods account ſtill thou knoweſt nothing at all; God notwithſtanding all thy Knowledg, looks upon thee but as an ignorant Sot: as it is ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 4.22, <hi>For my People are fooliſh, they have not known me; they are ſottiſh children, and have no underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Though thou mayſt hear a thouſand Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, if thou doſt not frame thy life according to the Rule and Preſcript of the Word of God, in Gods eſteem thou art as one that never heard a Sermon in all thy life: and is not this a pitiful thing, that a man for want of practiſe ſhall loſe all that he hath done: all his Prayers, and all his Hearing, and all his Communicating at the Lords Table? for an unpractical Chriſtian in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, hath done nothing at all; methinks this ſhould work upon your hearts. If ever therefore you deſire that God ſhould look upon you, as upon his Children, that God ſhould own you in a day
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:45614:225"/>when you would give a whole World for a ſmile of his face; If ever you deſire that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould give this teſtimony of you, <hi>Father, here are they that have kept thy Word;</hi> if ever you would have God to ſay to you, as he ſaith of ſome, <hi>Theſe are my Children:</hi> then reſt not in a bare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional profeſſion of the Truth; but let Profeſſion and Practice, Science and Conſcience go together. This is the firſt Branch of the Doctrine, or the firſt Propoſition, <hi>They that obey the will of God, ſhall know more of his Will.</hi>

            <p>I Come now to the ſecond Propoſition, which is this:
<q>He that doth the will of God, ſhall be more aſſured of what he knows.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is that which our Saviour implies, when he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf;</hi> that is, he ſhall know it more certainly, know it more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly. To this agrees that ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 8.23, 32, <hi>If you continue in my Word, then are you my Diſciples indeed, and you ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free.</hi> Such an aſſured Knowledg had the Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 6.69, <hi>And we believe, and are ſure, that thou art that Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> It was not a conjectural knowledg, but a certain knowledg; ſay they, <hi>We believe and are ſure.</hi> And ſuch a knowledg had Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12, <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that day;</hi> He is able to keep my Soul, my
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:45614:226"/>Salvation, which he calls his <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> which he had depoſited with God. For the better Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Truth, <hi>That he that doth the will of God, ſhall be more aſſured of what he knows;</hi> it may be demanded, <hi>What is this certainty, or aſſurance of knowledg?</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, There are ſome things to be premiſed, or Cautions to be obſerved, for the finding out the Nature of this ſure and certain Knowledg.</item>
               <item>Secondly, I will give you ſome diſtinctions of Knowledg, whereby you may ſee what it is I am ſpeaking of.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, I will then give you the Deſcription of this ſure and certain Knowledg.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. That you may know what this certainty of Knowledg is: there are ſome things to be premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſome Cautions for the finding out of this ſure and certain Knowledg, and the Cautions are theſe five:</p>
            <p>Firſt, When I ſpeak of ſure and certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, I do not mean an aſſurance of Salvation, neither do I ſpeak of the reflect act of Knowledg, whereby we know that which we know, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.3, <hi>Hereby we know that we know;</hi> but I ſpeak of that the Apoſtle calls the full aſſurance of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. When a man is ſo <hi>rooted, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth,</hi> (Epheſ. 4.14. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.) that he is not always doubting, imagining, haeſitating, <hi>and carried about with every wind of Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Caution is this, When I ſpeak of full aſſurance of underſtanding: you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that there cannot be ſuch a full aſſurance at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that will be abſolute and perfect: certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an abſolute, perfect certainty of Knowledg,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:45614:226"/>cannot be attained in this life, that is, free from all doubting; for our knowledg in this life at the beſt is but imperfect; <hi>We know but in part,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. Although it be not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect, yet it is ſo ſtrong that it will not be overſwayed by the opinion of others, though they be very learned men; and this is that which the Apoſtle means in that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, <hi>The ſpiritual man judgeth all things, but he himſelf is judged of no man:</hi> That is, he is able to judg, and diſcern between Truth and Error, between Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Gold, between Food and Poiſon; he is able to diſcern Error from Truth; <hi>He himſelf is judged of no man;</hi> that is, he is ſo certainly aſſured of the truth that he holds, that the contrary judgment of others, though men of greater parts, and greater Scholars, ſhall not overſway him, or make him to ſtagger. It is true indeed, <hi>Thomas</hi> ſtaggered a while at the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, yet he recovered himſelf, and afterwards came to that certainty, that he cryed out, <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> John 22.20. A man (for Example) may meet with ſome knots in Religion, fome knotty Diſputations, he may meet with ſome Objections that he doth not know how to anſwer: as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>That original ſin was propagated to the Soul, I know it certainly: but how it is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, I cannot tell.</hi> A man may meet with ſome Objections that he cannot anſwer: however, he will not be overſwayed ſo as to forſake the Truth, becauſe he cannot anſwer ſome Objections.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When I ſpeak of this full aſſurance of underſtanding or knowledg in the myſteries of our Salvation; this Caution likewiſe muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, That though it is true, that God doth
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:45614:227"/>beſtow it upon thoſe that do his will, yet it is not gained only by doing the will of God, but it is gained eſpecially by the gift of the Spirit of God. When Saint <hi>Peter</hi> made that excellent confeſſion of Chriſt, when our Saviour asked his Diſciples, <hi>But whom ſay ye that I am? he anſwered, and ſaid, Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God,</hi> (Matth. 16.15, 16, 17:) <hi>And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed art thou Simon Bar Jona, for fleſh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> It is the Spirit of God that leads us into all Truth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When I ſpeak of a certainty of Knowledg: you muſt remember, that it is not a common gift of the Spirit of God, but it is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gift of the Spirit of God: for ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11, 12, 13, <hi>To you it is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to others it is not given; for whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance: but whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away, even that he hath; therefore ſpeak I to them in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, becauſe they ſeeing, ſee not, and hearing, they heart not, neither do they underſtand.</hi> This ſame certainty of Knowledg, therefore, is not attained by any natural qualification: it is not a Knowledg that can be gotten, or learned in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures School: it is not gotten by Art or Induſtry, or reading of Books, neither is it gotten by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> had a Natural knowledg of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God.</hi> They knew God by a Natural light; but it is a Knowledg that is revealed by the Spirit of God; and therefore the Spirit of God is called <hi>the Spirit
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:45614:227"/>of Wiſdom, and Revelation, in the knowledg of him,</hi> Epheſ. 1.17.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Take this Caution, this aſſurance of Knowledg is gradual: that is, it hath different degrees: in ſome it is more, and in ſome it is leſs; ſome are but Babes in Chriſt, others there are that are ſtrong men: ſome <hi>are weak in the Faith,</hi> Rom. 14.1. Others are <hi>rooted in Chriſt, and built up in him, and ſtabliſhed in the Faith,</hi> Col. 2.7. This certainty of underſtanding at the firſt is but very weak; as the Diſciples of Chriſt in the great Point of the Reſurrection, at the firſt they were not clear in their knowledg of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.21, <hi>We truſted that it had been him which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael; beſide all this, to day is the third day ſince theſe things were done;</hi> ſo that now our hope is almoſt at an end, in the great buſineſs of our Saviours Reſurrection: they were not cleat at the firſt. A man that hath this certainty of Knowledg, may have but a weak beginning at the firſt, and yet notwithſtanding it will encreaſe more and more: like <hi>the morning light, that ſhines more and more to the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4.18. So that a man will at laſt come to be grounded, and ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the truth; he will <hi>be ſtedfaſt, and unmovable, abounding in the work of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>ult. He will be ſtabliſhed in Chriſt, and grow in grace, and in the knowledg of our Lord and Savour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Let me give you ſome Diſtinctions of Knowledg, that you may be the better able to find it out. Knowledg you muſt know is twofold: there is a Natural, and a Supernatural Knowledg. Firſt, Natural Knowledg which is ingraven in the Soul of man by Nature, as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:45614:228"/>knew God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. That is a Natural knowledg that is gotten by Art, and Induſtry, as the knowledg of Aſtronomy is, and the like.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Supernatural Knowledg, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the Spirit of God. Now the Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Knowledg is twofold: — Firſt, It is either common: — Or ſecondly, It is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. There is a common Supernatural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that is common to the Reprobates, as well as to the Elect; for Reprobates who ſin the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, they are enlightned with a Supernatural light. Every thing that is Supernatural, is not Spiritual; the Devils they have a Supernatural light, and yet it is not a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, nor ſanctifying light; and therefore they that ſin the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon light, which is Supernatural; the Text ſaith, <hi>They have received the knowledg of the truth,</hi> Heb. 10.26.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a ſaving Supernatural light, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is infuſed into the Souls of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, by the ſaving work of Gods holy Spirit. Now this ſupernatural ſaving light, that is again twofold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is either mediate, that is, that which is acquired by means: as Reading, Hearing, and Praying, waiting upon God in the uſe of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, according as God told Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the preaching of the Word, <hi>Mens eyes ſhould be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they ſhould be turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God,</hi> Acts 26.18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Or elſe it is immediate: and this is that light which is darted into the Soul without the uſe of means. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (for example) he
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:45614:228"/>was enlightned miraculouſly by a Revelation from Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. And ſo in the Converſion of the Jaylor, how wonderfully was he enlightned on a ſudden! <hi>Acts</hi> 16. And the Converſion of the Thief on the Croſs, it was done immediately by the Spirit of God. Now when I am ſpeaking of this certainty of Knowledg, I ſpeak not of a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but of a Spiritual Knowledg; neither do I ſpeak of a common Supernatural Knowledg, but of the ſanctifying and ſaving gift of the Spirit of God; neither do I ſpeak of the immediate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the means; but I ſpeak of the mediate in the uſe of means; therefore to come to the third thing, that is, to give you the Deſcription of this certain and aſſured Knowledg: and the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this.</p>
            <p>Certainty of Spiritual Knowledg, it is a ſaving work of the Spirit of God, whereby a Believer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives ſatisfying light, and doth give up his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding reſolvedly to thoſe Truths that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him. There are theſe five things to be noted in this Deſcription.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay it is a ſaving work of the Spirit of God. It is not the knowledg of Devils; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils have a Supernatural Knowledg; neither is it the knowledg of Hypocrites, ſuch a knowledg as they that ſin the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt may have: but it is that Knowledg that is darted into the Soul by the Holy Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks it of the Kingdom of Grace, as well as of the Kingdom of Glory; Man doth not know the work of the Spirit of Grace upon the heart:
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:45614:229"/>but ſaith he in the words following, <hi>God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God.</hi> And it is the Spirit of God, that is ſaid <hi>to guide us into all truth,</hi> John 16.13. That is the firſt thing in the Deſcription, it is a ſaving work of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a Knowledg whereby a Believer hath received ſatisfying light.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A Believer hath received light. The truth is, none doth know the Truth aright, but he that believes it; therefore believing and knowing the Truth, are joyned together: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, <hi>Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving, of them which believe, and know the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I note this, whereby a Believer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſatisfying light; <hi>But what is that light</hi> (may be, ſome of you will ſay) <hi>that may be called ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying light?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, and ſhall give you an account of it in theſe five particulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That is a ſatisfying Light, that is joyned with a powerful Conviction upon the Conſcience, when <hi>the Spirit of God doth eonvince us of ſin, and of Righteouſneſs, and Judgment,</hi> John 16.8. That is a ſatisfying Light, when the Spirit of God breaks in upon the Soul with ſuch an irreſiſtible Light, that a man cannot gainſay it, or withſtand it; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, When the Sun is riſen in the morning, a man then knows it is day: and if a thouſand ſhould ſay to the contrary, he would ſay, <hi>I know it is day.</hi> Such is the light of the Spirit of God; it is an irreſiſtible light, it breaks in upon the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:45614:229"/>heart with that power, that the heart cannot gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That is a ſatisfying Light, which ſettles and ſtabliſheth a man in the preſent Truth, that he will not be removed from it: When a man is rooted in the Faith, ſetled and ſtabliſhed in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, then he hath received a ſatisfying Light.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That is a fatisfying Light, when a man can act Faith upon that light he hath received, and make bold adventures for the Truth that he hath embraced, when he can act Faith upon it; ſo did thoſe three Worthies in <hi>Daniel.</hi> 3.17: they had received ſuch ſatisfying Light, that God was the true God, and his Worſhip the true Worſhip, that they ventured a Furnace for it; ſay they, <hi>If it be ſo, Our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery Furnace, and he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us out of thy hand, O King; but if not, be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not ſerve thy gods, nor worſhip thy Golden Image which thou haſt ſet up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, That is a ſatisfying Light, which will enable a man to diſcern between Truth and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: though Errour be masked with never ſuch fair pretences, yet notwithſtanding a man ſhall be able to diſcover that Errour, and abhor it: and though Truth be eclipſed with never ſo many falſe Gloſſes, and Interpretations, and never ſo much oppoſed: yet a man can diſcern it, and cloſe with it, and cleave to it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This is a ſatisfying Light, that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a man to reconcile ſome ſeeming differences that are in the Scriptures. Let me give you an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one or two: thoſe two places compared
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:45614:230"/>together, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6, <hi>And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the Earth, and it grieved him at his heart;</hi> but in <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19, it is ſaid, <hi>God is not as man that he ſhould lye, neither the Son of man that he ſhould repent.</hi> Now a man that hath this ſatisfying Light, he knows how to reconcile theſe two places thus: Repentance in God, is not a change of his Will, but of his Work; God is ſaid to repent after the manner of men, becauſe he doth thoſe things that man doth, when he repents. Let me give you another inſtance: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28, <hi>Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by Faith, without the deeds of the Law:</hi> But Saint <hi>James</hi> he tells the quite contrary, <hi>James</hi> 2.25, <hi>Ye ſee then, how by Works a man is juſtified, and not by Faith only.</hi> Now a man that hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Light, he reconciles theſe two thus: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> he ſpeaks of juſtification before God; and Saint <hi>James</hi> he ſpeaks of Juſtification before men: We are juſtified before God by Faith only, we are juſtified before men by works. Again, they may be reconciled thus: Faith doth juſtifie our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but good works doth juſtifie our Faith; Good works are no part of our Juſtification, but only a proof of our Juſtification.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, In the Deſcription I ſay this: A Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver having received a ſatisfying Light, gives up his underſtanding reſolvedly to thoſe Truths that are revealed to him. But you will ſay, <hi>When doth a man give up his underſtanding reſolvedly to thoſe Truths revealed to him?</hi> I will tell you,</p>
            <p>Firſt, When he is reſolved to part with every ſin that the Word of God diſallows and condemns, though it be as dear to him as his right hand, or his right eye; and when he can practice every
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:45614:230"/>Duty that the Word of God commands, though it be never ſo difficult. As for Example, the duty of Mortification, and Self-denyal, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, when he can purifie his heart by believing, and obeying the Truth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22, <hi>Seeing you have purified your Souls in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth, through the Spirit.</hi> And it is ſaid of many of the Prieſts, that <hi>they were obedient to the Faith,</hi> Acts 6.7. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.19: that <hi>he was not diſobedient to the Heavenly Viſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, A man gives up his underſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly to the truth, when he can plead for the truth, and not plead againſt it. Saith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8, <hi>For we can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth.</hi> Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, he laid down his life for this truth, <hi>That it was lawful for Miniſters to marry; I know</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that it is not a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truth; but becauſe I know it is the truth of God, rather than I will part with any truth, I will part with my life.</hi> So then, when a man can thus reſolvedly give up his underſtanding to the truth, that he will part with his life rather than part with the truth, then hath he attained to this certainty of Knowledg indeed. And thus you ſee the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it, and have the Point opened: now let me make Application of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If this be a certain truth, <hi>That they that do the Will of God, ſhall not only know more of Gods Will, but they ſhall know it more aſſuredly: they ſhall be ſure of what they know,</hi> and ſhall attain to this certainty of Knowledg that I have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of: then it ſerves to let us ſee what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all the Errours that are broached, and ſo greedily drunk in, in theſe days in which we live;
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:45614:231"/>what is the reaſon of that uncertainty, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy that is in Religion; that men are giddy-headed, turned with every wind of Doctrine and new Opinion; and ſuck in ſuch ſtrange and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Doctrines, and that there is ſo many Sects and Schiſms: the reaſon is, becauſe men never attained to this full aſſurance of Underſtanding, this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Knowledg that the Text ſpeaks of: <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> All the knowledg that they have of the Scripture, it may be it is but an Opinion, or a conjecture, or a gueſs, a notional knowledg, a knowledg that is taken up upon tradition, or truſt, not that they have any aſſurance of it in their own hearts and underſtandings: All the knowledg of <hi>Scepticks,</hi> thoſe that you call <hi>Seekers, Nullifidians,</hi> that believe nothing, all whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is to profeſs nothing, all their knowledg is but a meer Opinion; the truth is, they have no knowledg at all; <hi>If they did know the truth, the truth would make them free;</hi> If they had known the truth, they would have been rooted, and fetled, and eſtabliſhed in it: they would part with their lives, rather than part with the truth.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Leſſon you may learn hence, is this: It lets us ſee what the reaſon is of all that Atheiſm and looſneſs, and libertiniſm that is in the hearts of men, and practiſes of men at this day; the reaſon is, becauſe they never attained to any certainty of knowledg in the Doctrine of Chriſt, and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion: they never did believe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Promiſes, nor Threatnings of God cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially: For Example, Did men but believe the threatnings of the Word; to name two or three:
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:45614:231"/>When God ſaith, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the wicked he will rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt, this ſhall be the portion of their Cup,</hi> Pſalm 11.6. Again, when God ſaith, that <hi>he will wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch a one as goeth on ſtill in his treſpaſſes,</hi> Pſalm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>8.21. And God ſaith expreſsly, that <hi>no unrighteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God: neither For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, nor abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, nor Extortioners, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. And that Text ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>That the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and Murderers, and Sorcerers, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, and all lyars, ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone,</hi> Rev. 21.8. Did men but know theſe truths, were they but aſſured of them, durſt they do as they do? durſt they venture their immortal Souls, that muſt ſink or ſwim for ever, that are capable of endleſs bliſs, or endleſs, remidileſs miſery in Hell, more days than there are drops of water in the whole Ocean? Durſt they venture their precious Souls for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of every baſe luſt, as they do? No, they durſt not. Men do not know theſe truths: and becauſe they do not know them, therefore it is that they do not believe them; and becauſe they do not know and believe them, therefore <hi>there is in them an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.</hi> The firſt ſtep of the Souls departure from God, is by unbelief: ſo the firſt ſtep of the Souls approach to God, is by Faith; Unbelief is the cauſe of all other ſins. A man that doth not believe the Promiſes of God to embrace them, nor the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:45614:232"/>Threatnings of God to fear them, nor the Precepts of God to obey them: when he departs from God by unbelief, he departs to other ſins, and ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts further and further: ſo that the breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Soul, is never made up again: but ſuch a man departs from God ſtep by ſtep, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at laſt he comes to hear that Thunder-ſtriking ſentence, <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond Uſe is by way of Examination: and I beſeech you, my Brethren, to call your ſelves to an account, and examine whether you have this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of underſtanding, this aſſured Knowledg that I have diſcourſed of. May be you will ſay to me, <hi>But how ſhall we know whether we have it, or no? Anſw.</hi> I will tell you how you may know it, theſe three ways:
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, By the names or expreſſions that the Spirit of God gives it.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, By the Properties of it.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, By the Effects of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, You may know it by the names or Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that the Spirit of God gives it; ſuch Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as theſe now:</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is called a Knowledg of thoſe things which are moſt ſurely believed, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.1: Not barely believed, but certainly believed.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Expreſſion is, a being <hi>taught of God,</hi> John 6.45, <hi>And they ſhall be all taught of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is known by this Expreſſion, by <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Law of God in our hearts, upon the Tables of our hearts,</hi> Jer. 31.33. Heb. 8.10.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By this Expreſſion, by receiving <hi>the anointing that teacheth you all things,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.27, <hi>But the anointing which ye have received of him,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:45614:232"/>abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is known by this expreſſion, <hi>By ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the mind of Chriſt;</hi> or <hi>knowing the mind of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, It is known by this expreſſion, by <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high thoughts into the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5. When there is ſuch a light in a man, that it can anſwer thoſe Objections that are made againſt the truth: when it can likewiſe ſo ſtifle thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings and cavils of his back-ſliding heart, that none of them ſhall be able to beat down the truth, but he ſhall be able to ſtick to the truth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; ſuch a man hath this certainty of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is known by this expreſſion, <hi>the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.2, <hi>But the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This certainty of knowledg may be known by the Properties of it, I ſhall name but theſe four Properties:</p>
            <p>Firſt, This aſſuring Knowledg is ever an heart-humbling knowledg. Carnal knowledg, natural knowledg, unſanctifyed knowledg puffs a man up, it makes him like a pair of Bellows, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the Original ſignifies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1: but this aſſuring Knowledg, it ever makes a man baſe and humble in his own eyes: the more you know of God, and of the truths of God, and of your own ſelves, the more vile and baſe you will be in your own eyes: <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee: wherefore I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Job 42.5, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:45614:233"/>Secondly, This Knowledg is a reflective know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: it makes a man turn in upon his own heart, it makes a man to be wiſe for himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.12, <hi>If thou be wiſe, thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf.</hi> There is many a man that knoweth how to teach others, but yet he cannot teach himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 5.27, <hi>Lo this, we have ſearched it, ſo it is, hear it, and know thou it for thy good:</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is, <hi>Hear and know it for thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, This aſſured Knowledg is an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental knowledg: for it will make a man read ſome Sculpture or ingraving of the Spirit of God upon his own heart, that <hi>his heart will be Chriſts Epiſtle, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the living God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.3. The truth is, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (and I would have you to remember it) that all the truths of God to a carnal and unregenerate man, are Myſteries. No man (for example) knows what Repentance is, but the repenting Sinner; no man knows what Faith is, but the true Believer; no man knows what Regeneration is, but he that is regenerate; no man knows what Union with Chriſt is, but he that is united to Chriſt; no man knows what it is to have Communion with Chriſt in his Life, and Death, and Reſurrection, and Graces, and Comforts, but he that hath felt them in his own heart; no man knows it ſavingly, until he knows it experimentally. A ſick man doth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know what his diſeaſe is, than all the Phyſicians in the World, becauſe he feels it. A blind man may talk of Colours, that never ſaw them. A hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry man may talk of a rich Banquet, that he never taſted of: But now this is ſure knowledg, it is an experimental knowledg.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is a heart-warming knowledg: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:45614:233"/>knowledg, a notional knowledg, is but like the light of the Moon: it enlightens indeed in a dark night, but it doth not warm. But now this aſſured Knowledg is like the light of the Sun: it doth not only enlighten you, but it heats and warms your hearts, it will make you in love with Jeſus Chriſt, and to long for more Communion with him in Grace here, and in Glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You may know this certainty of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg by the Effects of it, and I ſhall name but theſe two:</p>
            <p>Firſt, This aſſured Knowledg will make you to hold faſt the Name of God, notwithſtanding all the oppoſition that you meet with: it will make you ſtick to the Truths of God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.31, <hi>I have ſtuck unto thy Teſtimonies, O Lord, put me not to ſhame.</hi> In <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13. God ſpeaks to the Church of <hi>Pergamus, Thou holdeſt faſt my Name, and haſt not denyed my Faith, even in thoſe days where Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas was my faithful Martyr, who was ſlain among you, where Satan dwelleth:</hi> Thou haſt kept my Name there, in the midſt of oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will make a man run any hazard ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than part with the Truth. See the courage of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 20.24, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in every City, ſaying, Bonds and afflictions abide me; but none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo I may finiſh my courſe with joy.</hi> The truth is, a little light, if it be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, will make a man to reſiſt temptations, that the allurements of the Fleſh, and the World, and the Devil ſhall not biaſs him, and carry him away. On the contrary, a great light, if it be not ſpiritual, will yield to every temptation: and hence it is, that ſometimes you ſee a man of weak parts ſtand out in
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:45614:234"/>an hour of temptation and tryal, when a man of ſtrong and great parts (if he wants this ſpiritual Light) falls fouly and fearfully. A man that hath once got this aſſured knowledg of the Truth, he will ſay, <hi>I will lay down my life, rather than I will part with the truth:</hi> another man that hath not received this Light, how will he ſhift, and ſhuffle, and temporize, and part with the truth, and ſwim with every ſtream, and ſail with every wind! How will he be a double-minded man in all his ways: and will be carried about with every wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Now to ſhut up all with this one word of Exhortation: I beſeech you in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you would labour for this full aſſurance of Underſtanding: that you would be rooted, and ſetled, and eſtabliſhed in the truth: get a ſetled underſtanding. Now to preſs you to this, let me uſe but theſe two Motives:</p>
            <p>The firſt is this; The truth is, there is no proper Knowledg where this certainty is wanting, it is at the beſt elſe, but matter of conjecture. See an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> before he had this ſpiritual Light, in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.9, <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things againſt Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.</hi> It was but his thought and conjecture; whereas when a man hath once gotten this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Knowledg, then he underſtands the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures indeed, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.45, <hi>Then opened he their underſtandings, that they might underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> And you may obſerve in the Parable of the Sower, and the four Grounds, three whereof were naught, and one good: of the three firſt it is not ſaid, that they received the Word with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but only the fourth Ground heard the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:45614:234"/>Word, and received it with underſtanding, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.23.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Motive is this, it will be of ſingular uſe to you in erroneous and backſliding times: it will be of ſingular advantage to your poor Souls, when you ſhall have that Knowledg, that you can diſcern Truth from Error; and Gold from Copper, and Food from Poyſon. Our Saviour here in the Text ſpeaks of it as the Priviledg of a Believer, or obedient Chriſtian, that he ſhall be able to diſcern true Doctrine from falſe. Certainly, in ſuch times as we live in, wherein the Name of God is ſo much blaſphemed, and the Truth is eclipſed, and the Sun of the Goſpel is ſo much darkned by thoſe fogs and miſts of Error: it is a ſingular Priviledg for a man to have a ſetled knowledg in the Truth, that he may not be carried about with every wind of Doctrine. But it may be you will ſay, <hi>What courſe muſt we take to get this certainty of knowledg?</hi> I ſhall tell you that in three words:</p>
            <p>Firſt, If ever you deſire to have this full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Knowledg, you muſt reſolve to walk humbly with your God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25.9, <hi>The meek will be guide in Judgment, and the humble will he teach his way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Strive to be growing Chriſtians. That is an excellent Scripture, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.3, <hi>Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you would get this full aſſurance of Underſtanding, I cannot give you a better directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than the Text gives you, which our Saviour here preſcribes you; do but the Will of God, that is, practice what you know, and you ſhall know more: and you ſhall know in a better manner, and know more aſſuredly than you do. I conclude with
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:45614:235"/>an excellent Speech of a Reverend Divine that is now with God; <hi>Men, in matters of Religion, do therefore become Scepticks, becauſe they are not Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:</hi> that is, men are ever doubting of Truth; they will be <hi>Seekers, Nullifidians,</hi> they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing, becauſe they do not practice what they know. It is the practical Chriſtian that ſhall know much of God: that ſhall have the mind of God made known to him, ſhall have more of the incomes of the Spirit of God; whereas, if you will not be practical Chriſtians, you ſhall be always floating, and wavering, and double-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ready to be ſeduced, and led into by-paths of Error, which will endanger the Salvation of your immortal Souls. <hi>The Lord help us to practice thoſe Truths that we know, that he may delight in us, and do us good, and lead our feet in the way of life.</hi>
